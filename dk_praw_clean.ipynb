Most of the time people assume I’m british, but I’ve gotten Australian, German, French, Irish a few times, and Scottish once. (Most of these accents don’t sound similar in any way, I’m aware). I know I talk a little weird, but I never really think of myself as having a particular accent, just mild rhotacism.  Usually when people comment on my supposed accent I laugh and say “I don’t have an accent, I just can’t talk right”, to which they respond “No, I don’t think you talk weird, it just sounds like you have a really nice accent”. \\n\\nIt’s gotten to the point I myself am worrying that people might think I’m faking an accent, or maybe I *am* faking one and don’t even realize it (sounds insane, I know). Sometimes I change the way I say things to mask my rhotacism, but even then I don’t hear an accent, and most of the time I am speaking completely naturally (really only a few words, and I use them rarely)\\n\\nDoes anyone else with speech issues experience this?

I'm super happy with my job, really happy to finally be making money but now I find myself pretty bored with life. Now that I have some money to spend, I want to go out and have fun but it's difficult to find the time and the company to have fun with. Most of my friends are still in school which takes up all of their time and money. They don't exactly have energy or money to go out for brunch or see movies etc. Plus, I work in the hospitality industry and my schedule is the exact opposite to most of my friends. For example, my weekend is usually Sunday-Monday/Tuesday. Each weekend I get excited to go out and do something but now that the new semester has started, nobody is anywhere to be found on Sundays-Tuesdays. My roommates were all completely out of the house during all my days off and I was left lazing around the house feeling bored and lonely. Usually if my friends are free, they want to stay in and hangout at home which is fine but I wanna go out and do things rather than sit around at home like I usually do. \\n\\nI also feel like so much of my free time is taken up by recovering from work and running errands/doing chores. By the time I'm caught up on groceries, laundry, cleaning, etc, I have to be right back at work. I just feel super understimulated and bored these days. Even work is super slow right now and I feel so bored waiting for the day to end. It's also just so tough to do things in the winter. It's such a hassle to commute anywhere sometimes it doesn't even feel worth it. But staying at home doing nothing isn't fun either. \\n\\nI'm gonna try just taking myself on dates instead of waiting for my friends to be free but certain things just genuinely aren't as fun by yourself. Like I wanna go out for brunch so I can chat/gossip and have a few drinks with a friend, not so I can sit there alone thinking to myself like I do the rest of the day, y'know? Or shopping/thrifting. I don't mind doing it by myself but it ends up feeling more like a task/journey rather than a fun day out since nobody's there to keep me company.\\n\\nWhat ways do you guys break out of the everyday boring routine of working full time especially when not everyone is available/also super busy? I'm really sick of this feeling of boredom! I wanna live my life!!\",\n",

The lighting was warm, and dim enough to be moody but bright enough to read by. \\n\\nNow almost every restaurant has that giant open dining room with glaring LED lights, [these exact metal chairs](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/a-chair-tolix.jpg), with some ugly table that looks like a butcher block, some godawful electronic music blasting, and the conversations of dozens of other diners echoing off all the bare surfaces. Oh, and in the summer the A/C will be set to 65F, no matter how people are dressed for the actual weather.\\n\\n My local library underwent a renovation a few years ago, and the result is absolutely antithetical to how a library should be. More like walking into a gigantic airport bookstore. All white everything, those same glaring LED lights, this time competing with skylights. All the soft surfaces were removed so the whole space is another echo chamber. All the comfy reading nooks replaced with high-top tables and stools. TVs everywhere (thankfully silent) playing informational slides on a loop. I used to go the library to read. Now it's just pick up a book or two and get the hell out because it's so uncomfortable in there.\\n\\nThen there's the mall. Remember how comfortable malls were pre-Y2K? An endless sea of brass & glass with relaxing music and mood lighting, totally cut off from the outside world. The mall was an isolated world unto itself where it didn't feel real to spend money, so you did. Then they started renovating, trying to be more open and bright to compete with SoDoSoPa or whatever, and killing the whole mall vibe in the process. Now malls are dying and they deserve it.\\n\\nThe only places that are still comfortable are bars, and that's because a bar makes more money the longer you sit there. I suppose everywhere else is trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThank you for listening to this cantankerous old man rant about nothing.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Dear Internet,\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThis post will tell you about my life and how I started loving somebody. Just to keep things private let her call Nexus. It all started in school when I was 15 and she was 14. Yaa I know it is not legal to date or enter into relationship at that age but at that time my intention was not that. We were good friends. We had a school bus through which we used to commute to the school and back to our respective home. I liked the way she talked and it all seemed divine and godly to me whatever she spoke. We had conversation while in the bus and she used to sit with me in bus in the last year of my school in 10th grade. We had conversation on basically everything and that conversation was enough for me to get relaxed after tiring school. I always longed for her presence and I was overjoyed whenever I saw her after a long vacation.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs the time passed, we also grew up and I basically went to a cram school in senior secondary for preparing for entrance examinations in college. My interaction with her decreased and almost reduced to zero during my cram school days. However before the starting of the cram school when the final examination of grade 10 were there, I secretly kept a letter in her bag putting my all the feelings into it and hoped that one day she would see that letter but as there was no name written on that letter just a secret coded name was written, I knew that she would not be able to find out who wrote that. Actually, I never had courage to express my feelings to her directly and even today though I am less hesitant and more expressive than before. However she didn't find that letter in her school bag because it got into one the remotest partition and corner of the bag. However, on the occasion of one of the festival, I visited her house and thinking that this may be the last time I would be able to meet her in the next coming two years, I told her that I have kept a secret letter in her bag but I didn't tell her what I wrote in that letter.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTime passed and after a month or so, again I met her and asked her about that letter. She said she had intuition that I had feelings for her and it was not a great surprise for her. However she respected my expression and accepted another letter I wrote for her. Actually, she used to stay at her home most of the time (except going to school) and at her home there were many elders and it was not safe to discuss and talk about that at her home. Again after a two months, I met her at her home and gave her another letter. I usually used to write what was my state of my mind and what I thought about her. I always consider my love for her as something divine and godly. It was the purest feeling that I ever had and I never ever had dreamt of getting into physical relationship. Nor I believed in the concept of relationship with her but what meant most important for me is her presence and her talks. I could sit and listen to her chit-chats whole day without getting bored.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nNow, it was time that my exams approached and I became more and more concentrated about my studies. In 2019, I actually met her once in May on the occasion of her birthday. After that time passed and then CoVID-19 came. She went to another city as her parents' job was transferrable. During the summer of 2020, I contacted her on Instagram and she replied what she thought about the happenings of last 1 or 1 and half a year or so. She said that she respected the expression of mine and was glad that I told her directly rather than getting to know it through others. She said that she didn't have any mood to get into relationship or so.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nFrom that day, I stopped saying that I love her or how much I love her to her directly but my feelings for her got more intense and magnified. Then after a year of silence or so, I again contacted her and this time she got infected by CoVID-19. I prayed day and night for her well being but as I was hundreds of miles away from her, I was literally helpless except praying for her. Then time passed and we had conversation like simple hello, hi, what are you doing, all good and general well being of each other. Actually, it was me who asked for her well being, wished her on special occasions and just texted her. Then comes the time when I went to her city in March 2023. I went to that city just to explore but my main intention was not to explore the city but to see her in person. It had been almost 3 year and 9 months when I last saw her or met her in person. We never had video calls as I thought it would be breach of her privacy or intruding into her space. In March 2023, I met her and that day my heart was filled with joy and fear at the same time. I literally had a electric shock going through my veins. I was not able react to the situation. She was actually tired because of her exams and was not in the mood of talking and it was again it was her house where her elder brother(who is a good friend of mine) and her parents were there. I didn't get the opportunity to talk to her in private as everybody was there. I wanted to have a private chat with her and wanted to directly tell her my feelings once more. But that didn't happened and I returned back to my city.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAfter that it has been almost 9 months since then and I had same routine of asking for her well-being and wishing her on her birthday and on festivals and special occasions. I don't know what I can do now but It has been almost 8 years and I don't have any clue? I know I can't move on like other Gen-Zs because I love her more than anything else in this world. I have decided that I would never marry or get into any relationship if I couldn't be with her. I know it is painful for me sometimes and often I feel overwhelmed but for me love is not something that you do or change like your clothes. It is the purest feeling for me.\\n\\nI will be a complete person if she will acknowledge the feeling I have. I love her and that's all I know.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAny suggestions/comments/similar-life experiences/ advice is welcomed. I would love to hear that.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nDear Internet, be kind to me please.\",\n",

Our previous neighbours moved shortly after we did, saying they were renting out their place so they could live out of province. Super lovely and amazing older couple. Now the people that moved in are loud. \\n\\nFor the first little bit, we didn’t have any issues with them. They never leave their house, never come out unless it’s one of the girl’s boyfriend for a smoke. But it’s progressively gotten bad over time. At one point there was tons of screaming and yelling, that the police were called by one of the girl’s mom’s. The police banged for about 20ish minutes before they went around back and got in. Clearly nothing happened but since then, screaming has gotten worse, banging noises sporadically, screams of genuine pain and anger happen, and today there was screams of pain, sounds of running up and down the stairs and since it’s thinner walls/older home, my husband and I heard the girl screaming for the boyfriend to let her go and stop touching her. Even said to get out of her way, and we’ve heard the door open several times only to be slammed shut and we heard him say she’s not leaving. \\n\\nThere’s been several instances where the boyfriend is clearly high out of his mind and super drunk. A few times even outside in the back blasting hip hop music, screaming lyrics out and jumping around almost falling off the deck, clearly unstable. \\n\\nWe’re scared because my husband works 10+ hour days and I’m a student so I’m at home a lot when I’m not at school. I’ve never felt safe with this neighbour, especially lately, and clearly when the police were called nothing happened. It’s hard because the boyfriend is generally nice to my husband when he’s out for a smoke coincidentally. But we’re afraid if we were to say anything to the police or their landlord that it’d be 100% tracked back to us and if nothing happens, who knows what could happen. We’re concerned for the girl and her friend living in there and that in regard to the landlords that destruction of property might be happening. Wondering if anyone has any advice?\\n\\nUPDATE: Have texted a lengthy message to the landlords and have given them dates/times as to when stuff has happened, including the police being called. Still haven’t heard anything from her and it’s been all day. But earlier this evening I noticed one of the girls and the guy leaving for not even 5 minutes through the back and coming back which is the first I’ve seen of one of the girls. ',\n",

Only thing I don\\'t is start and some middle parts. If anyone\\'s wanna rea here it is-\\n\\n24-01-2024\\nIt\\'s about a robbery and a big robbery. I don\\'t know any people at all and i don\\'t know where it started. There was a plan and we went ahead then we have to cross this border via rail so there was checkup inside some building. And also for robbery there was a lotta people involved and weirdly some dolls similiar looking ever at size smaller than my finger dolls.then we go ahead across border. Maybe we complete robbey and come back and while coming back there was this big bomb attached to the last bogey of train and rail track creating friction. Also before that we were all in a room where when I went to chel up luggage I saw those dolls in a small box I talked about, all in red dress. Also about that bomb is that we if we stop the train the bomb will touch the ground n we\\'ll all explode. and at last distance our train starts to stop idk why so we go to the bomb and pull it while the train is running to maontain the friction. The bomb starts to get red but I don\\'t remember what happens to the bomb. But I do remember that train stops and in the station and 3 of us (all boys) are across this big lake we have to swin and some people involved in robbery already crossed it. So I go first then those to also starts to swin and while swimming I get so sleepy and starts to sleep and drown. But after hearing their voices I wake up in the water and starts swimming again. After we reach other side of lake we had to go through checkup so we do in this big facility. I do remember sending our bag for checkup after reaching other side of lake. So after checkup we are in this room together at our station and one of the guy vomitss so badly that I dont take that well and starts to sing and spit in basin (also i remember there was a basin for every guy and aside of every locker). The thing is I clearly remember what i sing \"ohh motha fuckar ohhhh motha fuckar and when I spit in dream I also spit in real life lmao. So I feel liquid n woke up.

       "  'selftext': 'Has anyone quit anything (not necessarily a job) because they were too scared, or not cut out for something, even though they still kind of want to do the said thing? I’m feeling dejected, silly, and stupid all at the same time, and I am wondering if anyone has felt something similar. \\n\\nMy husband and I have skied five times; we took a beginner lesson last year. We started out at a very small, rural resort. We have only skied the bunny hill and the one green trail that they offer. Last Sunday we checked out a different, larger resort.  We are not comfortable with blue runs yet; we had all intentions to stick to the different green trails.\\n\\nWe started out at their smallest green trail, which was great! Let me preface this by saying that getting off the chair lift scares me! I have yet to master getting off a chair lift. The chair lift for this first trail was relatively easy; I fell the first time, but then got the hang of it on the second go around. We got in a few runs and had a great morning. \\n\\nThen we went to another green slope. Here\\'s where the fun stopped... The slope while getting off the chair lift was super steep. I saw it two seconds before getting off and said, \"Oh no...\" My husband and I both wiped out. I came down hard and I\\'m certain I bruised, maybe even fractured my tailbone. So then, in a lot of pain and wiping the tears away, we then had to try to ski down that slope, which felt a lot more like a blue, even black, in our books. We managed the first half of the slope, but then it evened out before dropping off to, what felt like to us, a cliff! I ended up taking my skis off and walked down. My husband managed to get down, but he said he was not comfortable at all. \\n\\nIt definitely put a damper on our day. We did get some more runs in down the first green trail, but I was so fearful after our earlier experience that the fun was gone. \\n\\nI feel like I could ski the smallest slope 150 times, and I’d still be too scared to go on that other chair lift and “green” trail. One fall off that particular chair lift the wrong way, and I could be seriously be injured. How are people supposed to progress and advance??? \\n\\nWhy do chair lifts have to be the way they are? Why can’t all ski lifts be a j-bar or a t-bar? Why can’t chair lifts stop completely for a second or two, for you to ski off a flat section?  (Skiers, please be nice. I’m frustrated, and mostly just speaking hyperbolically at this point.) \\n\\nI am wondering if the anxiety, being fearful of the chair lift, being scared of injuries, and dealing with the injuries themselves is even worth it anymore. By the time I’m at the bottom of a run, I’m thinking, ‘Oh no, time to face the chair lift again.’ I’m seriously considering trying cross country skiing next year instead. I live in a cold, snowy area, and the whole point of trying skiing was to find more joy in the wintertime. \\n\\nI am so mad and upset at myself because I had these silly visions of getting better and better at skiing, taking ski vacations, etc. We had wanted to try a third ski resort, but now I don’t want to because I don’t know what the chair lift is like. I don’t want to be seen as a quitter. I feel like it’s one thing to put yourself out of your comfort zone (taking the ski lesson) but why should someone have to go through something that absolutely terrifies them? \\n\\nI had thought of just continuing to ski the bunny slope and the two greens we know for all time, but is it worth it? I’m still scared of the smaller chair lifts. \\n\\nHas anyone else gone through something remotely similar? I’d be surprised if a skier managed to come across this post. \\n\\nIf you made it to the end of this, thanks! I am a journalist, so it’s in my nature to write long with lots of description, haha!',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"When I was a kid, I didn't really ''put effort into'' making friends because my family had a lot of REALLY close friends who had children that I basically grew up with. When I'm with these ''kids'' (we're adults now lol) that's the only time I get this sense of family and belonging. It feels like the connection that we have between one another is special. For better or worse, a chunk of us don't live in the same countries so we only get to do this 2-3 times a year.\\n\\nIn school, I was never part of friend groups because I felt like these people were trying to act ''cool'' for having a lot of friends. (What does that even mean?? 😃) I had individual friends but not a clique.\\n\\nIn university, I was markedly older than my peers and I really didn't feel like I had anything in common with them. I did make two close friends for life there but that's that.\\n\\nIn almost 10 years of work I have never made a single friend with whom I would hang out after hours. I'm very introverted at work even though I'm quite extroverted ''IRL''. Always a desk job, always with people significantly older than me, always with people who I did not feel like I can relate with. I had a girlfriend from work once but that's that. I have definitely started to work on this after I had a conversation about it with my mother - she was/is also like that - very very rarely clicks with the people she works with. I have put in some effort to be more present in the office even though she has SO MANY FRIENDS outside work. At the end of the day this one is probably on me.\\n\\nI think I am very good at 1 on 1 conversations. I believe I am an interesting person to talk to. I can go to a bar or social event alone and I will almost instantly find someone to talk to without being intruisive. Example: when I went to a corporate team building event in 2022. Over 200 people. I arrived around 6 in the evening and up until 6 in the morning I had long and meaningful conversations (probably an hour or so) with about 10 different people whom I hadn't met before. This begs the question - why didn't this lead to anything further? Why didn't I actually become friends with any of these people? \\n\\nI know that 99% of friend groups need to have a common environment where comradery can flourish. You basically can't pick random people off the street and ''create'' a friend group, there needs to be something to keep them together and in contact. \\n\\nI have (had) friend ''''''''groups''''''''' of 3-4-5 people but that doesn't give me the sense of belonging that I'm talking about.\\n\\nHere is what I have identified so far as my potential shortcomings:\\n\\n1. I'm passive. I think this is the biggest and most significant one. Be the change that you want to see in the world. I could organize stuff with people and not just wait for them to happen. The social things that I do have almost always been someone asking/inviting me to go somewhere/ do something, almost never initiated by me.\\n\\n2. Maybe I'm delusional? Maybe I'm not as interesting or likeable as I think I am? Maybe I dominate conversations too much? I definitely don't have the need to be liked by everyone so I don't suck up to people and I'm fine with someone not being my fan so idk about that... I don't think it's true but... maybe?\\n\\n3. I like having the attention on me in a way that the flow of the conversation is not interrupted. Maybe that's why I (think I) flourish in 1 on 1 conversations - people are not distracted. I have their undivided attention and there is no jumping from topic to topic the way that it often happens with group conversations. I like to be heard.\\n\\n4. My interests have almost always been ones that do not require other people. idk... cubing, true crime, chess, science and general knowledge stuff, etc. etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nI've started going to BJJ now and I hope that with consistency I could be able to make friends there and potentially insert myself somehow as I like a couple of the guys over there but who knows? I'm going to the office more often, I'm trying to organize more stuff with my (individual 😀) friends.\\n\\nIt's possible that I'm chasing flying pigs. I'm looking for a group of people to be part of my identity the way my childhood friends are most certainly a very important part of who I am as a person and that's simply unattainable.\\n\\nThoughts, criticism?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi everyone, I hope you are having a great day. I’m a huge movie buff and I love watching all kinds of films, from classics to indie gems. But sometimes I feel like some movies don’t get the recognition or appreciation they deserve, either because they are overshadowed by more popular ones, or because they are misunderstood or misjudged by critics or audiences.\\nSo I wanted to ask you, what are some of the most underrated movies that you love? Movies that you think are brilliant, but not many people have seen or heard of, or movies that you think are unfairly criticized or overlooked. And why do you love them? What makes them special or unique to you?\\nI’ll start with a few of my favorites:\\nThe Fall (2006): This is a visually stunning and emotionally moving fantasy adventure film, directed by Tarsem Singh and starring Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru. It’s about a hospitalized stuntman who tells a fantastical story to a young girl, using the people and objects around him as inspiration. The story is shown in vivid colors and breathtaking locations, while the reality is shown in muted tones and bleak settings. The film explores the power of imagination, storytelling, and friendship, and it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I’ve ever seen. It’s a hidden gem that deserves more attention and praise.\\nThe Prestige (2006): This is a mind-blowing and twisty thriller, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. It’s about two rival magicians who compete to create the ultimate illusion, while sacrificing everything in their obsession. The film is full of surprises, secrets, and revelations, and it keeps you guessing until the very end. It’s a masterful and clever film that explores the themes of obsession, rivalry, sacrifice, and identity. It’s one of Nolan’s best films, in my opinion, and it’s often overlooked by his other more famous works.\\nThe Truman Show (1998): This is a brilliant and original comedy-drama, directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey. It’s about a man who discovers that his entire life is a reality TV show, and that everyone he knows is an actor. The film is a satire of the media, consumerism, and the human condition, and it raises some interesting questions about free will, reality, and identity. It’s also a showcase of Carrey’s dramatic range, as he portrays a man who goes from blissful ignorance to existential crisis. It’s a film that is both funny and poignant, and it’s one of my all-time favorites.\\nSo, what are some of the most underrated movies that you love? I’d love to hear your thoughts and recommendations.',\n",
