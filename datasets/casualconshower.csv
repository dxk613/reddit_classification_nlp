Anyone else with speech problems get comments about their “accent”?,"So, I have what I think of as a very blank accent, think the most boring, standard American accent. However, I also have had trouble pronouncing my R’s my entire life. I was in speech therapy through my elementary school for a few years until they decided I was good enough (I wasn’t). 

Well, for *years* I’ve been getting compliments on my accent and being asked where I’m from. Most of the time people assume I’m british, but I’ve gotten Australian, German, French, Irish a few times, and Scottish once. (Most of these accents don’t sound similar in any way, I’m aware). I know I talk a little weird, but I never really think of myself as having a particular accent, just mild rhotacism.  Usually when people comment on my supposed accent I laugh and say “I don’t have an accent, I just can’t talk right”, to which they respond “No, I don’t think you talk weird, it just sounds like you have a really nice accent”. 

It’s gotten to the point I myself am worrying that people might think I’m faking an accent, or maybe I *am* faking one and don’t even realize it (sounds insane, I know). Sometimes I change the way I say things to mask my rhotacism, but even then I don’t hear an accent, and most of the time I am speaking completely naturally (really only a few words, and I use them rarely)

how to break away from the boredom of working full time?,"I recently finally scored a job after being unemployed for so long. I'm super happy with my job, really happy to finally be making money but now I find myself pretty bored with life. Now that I have some money to spend, I want to go out and have fun but it's difficult to find the time and the company to have fun with. Most of my friends are still in school which takes up all of their time and money. They don't exactly have energy or money to go out for brunch or see movies etc. Plus, I work in the hospitality industry and my schedule is the exact opposite to most of my friends. For example, my weekend is usually Sunday-Monday/Tuesday. Each weekend I get excited to go out and do something but now that the new semester has started, nobody is anywhere to be found on Sundays-Tuesdays. My roommates were all completely out of the house during all my days off and I was left lazing around the house feeling bored and lonely. Usually if my friends are free, they want to stay in and hangout at home which is fine but I wanna go out and do things rather than sit around at home like I usually do. 

I also feel like so much of my free time is taken up by recovering from work and running errands/doing chores. By the time I'm caught up on groceries, laundry, cleaning, etc, I have to be right back at work. I just feel super understimulated and bored these days. Even work is super slow right now and I feel so bored waiting for the day to end. It's also just so tough to do things in the winter. It's such a hassle to commute anywhere sometimes it doesn't even feel worth it. But staying at home doing nothing isn't fun either. 

I'm gonna try just taking myself on dates instead of waiting for my friends to be free but certain things just genuinely aren't as fun by yourself. Like I wanna go out for brunch so I can chat/gossip and have a few drinks with a friend, not so I can sit there alone thinking to myself like I do the rest of the day, y'know? Or shopping/thrifting. I don't mind doing it by myself but it ends up feeling more like a task/journey rather than a fun day out since nobody's there to keep me company.

I also really like the line “I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror.” There are two meanings in my mind for that line: 1. Willingly partaking in harmful/self destructive behavior but refusing to self reflect and 2. Always looking towards the next goal line/accolade but not acknowledging all the great things you’ve done already.

The best way to get to know someone is by observing them,"Years ago, when I was still in school, I noticed the way my ""friends"" treated me compared to how they treated each other or others - they were so comfortable humiliating me while going out of their way to talk each other up. That's when I realized that they probably weren't just joking the whole time and that they certainly weren't my friends. I decided it's better to be alone than lonely amongst people who suck all joy and life out of me with their nasty personalities. But they taught me a great lesson. Sometimes, when I find someone I think I can get along with, I first start observing them from afar to see and understand the type of person they are, the way they interact with others, how they behave in certain situations. I started working a new place fairly recently and just by hearing some of my coworkers' conversations, I know that I'd never want them (except 1 person) as my friends due to how judgmental, gossipy and bitter they all are. It may take me a long time to meet and warm up to people, even longer to befriend them, but at least I stopped wasting my time and energy on people who simply don't deserve it.",0,1706183554.0,t3_19f7m0i
Am I too Reddit-pilled?,"Browsing Reddit for a few years got me instinctively going for the comments whenever I see an interesting post. Usually the comments provide more context, tell you if a post is false information, tell funny relevant stories etc.

At this point I can’t not read the comments on anything interesting, even on YouTube or Twitter. I feel like something is missing if I don’t know other people’s thoughts on something, which is part of the reason I can’t stand Twitter. The replies of each tweet are just nonsense promotions, Onlyfans, and unrelated memes. 

People speak of the “hive mind” and “Echo chambers” of Reddit, which is funny to me when it’s coming from a Twitter user with 1000 blocked accounts and a feed of tweets from only their close friends.

Skipped school because I wasn't prepared for 2 tests.

I literally have mental breakdowns because I don't have enough time to study, that's all I do for most of the week, today I had some really important tests that I didn't have the time to prepare myself for, so I decided to just not attend school and study. 

The thing is my parents are really strict so even suggesting such an idea would add a lot of headache that I don't need. (Although I will never understand the mentality, both of them came from rural regions and had horrible grades)

I'm avoiding them like the plague! Sure, I have my share of social media, for better or for worse. But for now, I'm just happy to not be using those apps in particular.

I owe on taxes for the first time in my adult life (33).,"As I’m preparing my taxes this year, it looks like not enough federal taxes have been taken from my income recently so I owe approximately $1,600. Looking into it, it turns out the W-4 form was updated in 2017 but I’ve had this job for 10 years so it never occurred to me I needed to update my form. I’m not sure exactly why this year is different, but I’m really frustrated because I’ve paid someone to do my taxes the past 4 years as we had a unique tax situation that made me more comfortable paying a professional, and in those 4 years they never once asked me about my W-4 or filing status or mentioned that I should update it annually/when life changes occur.

It gets kinda annoying when you post a comment, want to edit it, edit it and during that time the person already responded back to the old one, then you have to tell them to reread it or re-explain it.

Have you noticed how uncomfortable public places have gotten lately?,"I was perusing TikTok this morning and [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@retro.avocado/video/7306673148445887774) came across my feed. The poster was lamenting the loss of cozy coffee shops, and how they've all become too bright, too loud, too uncomfortable.

It got me thinking that it's true of a lot more than coffee shops. Restaurants in general used to be a lot more comfortable. The dining room would separated into smaller dining areas. I suppose that was a necessity of having a smoking section, but the divisions were more than just that. Chairs were plush and comfortable. Booths were tall and somewhat private. There were curtains and upholstery and tablecloths and plants that all absorbed sound and made the space acoustically pleasing. The lighting was warm, and dim enough to be moody but bright enough to read by. 

Now almost every restaurant has that giant open dining room with glaring LED lights, [these exact metal chairs](https://www.eatwell101.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/a-chair-tolix.jpg), with some ugly table that looks like a butcher block, some godawful electronic music blasting, and the conversations of dozens of other diners echoing off all the bare surfaces. Oh, and in the summer the A/C will be set to 65F, no matter how people are dressed for the actual weather.

 My local library underwent a renovation a few years ago, and the result is absolutely antithetical to how a library should be. More like walking into a gigantic airport bookstore. All white everything, those same glaring LED lights, this time competing with skylights. All the soft surfaces were removed so the whole space is another echo chamber. All the comfy reading nooks replaced with high-top tables and stools. TVs everywhere (thankfully silent) playing informational slides on a loop. I used to go the library to read. Now it's just pick up a book or two and get the hell out because it's so uncomfortable in there.

Then there's the mall. Remember how comfortable malls were pre-Y2K? An endless sea of brass & glass with relaxing music and mood lighting, totally cut off from the outside world. The mall was an isolated world unto itself where it didn't feel real to spend money, so you did. Then they started renovating, trying to be more open and bright to compete with SoDoSoPa or whatever, and killing the whole mall vibe in the process. Now malls are dying and they deserve it.

The only places that are still comfortable are bars, and that's because a bar makes more money the longer you sit there. I suppose everywhere else is trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible.

My birthday is today and it felt like any other day...,"I'm turning 27. It really felt like a typical day, void of anything special. I don't have anything planned, neither simple or extravagant to celebrate it just because my mindset was so set on treating it like every other day. 

Except, the world will not let you treat it as such. 

A couple of my friends, my cousins, my parents, and my siblings didn't let me feel that way at all. A simple text from each of them saying, ""Happy Birthday!"" gave me a bit of a push to feel blissful and joy. 

It's not much, but it's there. A kind gesture. And I'm grateful for it. 

I know that I'm not that old yet. There's still alot of life left in me despite how much I like to reminisce with my friends on how old we feel. About how time is fleeting so quickly. 

I'm going to try and make the push to better myself. To take this energy swelling within me to do something with my life, hopefully something good for the world, even if it's a small one.

I am not sure about my feelings as of late,"It's really odd for the longest time I had extremely neutral feelings about anything and everything particularly since I moved to another country and had to move to another school with a language I didn't know. In around a year I have made great progress and have lately been feeling great about myself, even started training and just caring for myself more. I have never been a very emotional person but I feel like I have lately just gotten extremely indifferent about the existence of others and acting in a way in regards to myself that makes me question my actions.

I have been acting a lot more impulsively and gotten angrier over the tiniest things other do lately even getting aggressive meanwhile feeling ecstatic about the tiniest thing I do, although for my whole life I've been a really calm person with good self-control if not a slightly negative mood. I feel like if this goes on I might do something regretful, what can I do?

On the upside I have gotten a lot more confident and cheerful in general though.

I got married!!!,"Man, this is something I never thought would happen. We eloped, and it's been a wild ride the last week taking some time to celebrate. We are back home now and while I knew every day life wouldn't change much, wearing a ring still serves of the bond and commitment that blossomed into this reality with my spouse I have the privilege of sharing. It took a few relationships before I found the person right for me, and I never knew how the path would unfold to this point until maybe a year or so ago. It’s wild how other endings in the form of other relationships or life choices gave way to this new beginning, even if it’s largely already the same life I have been leading now for several years with the same person I love. I suppose that’s part of the beauty, the commitment to permanence and life together the union of marriage represents. 

In many regards, this was the last part of life I felt I still had to step into, so to speak. I have been very fortunate with how my career has gone the last two years, compounded upon prior years. I was ultimately able to achieve the various personal ambitions and dreams I have set out for myself, a number of which I never knew if I would’ve been able to accomplish.

Finally over my crush after a year,"I think the biggest turn-off was when I realized how his mood affected the way he interacted with others. For example, when he was upset for whatever reason, he'd completely ignore my existence and not even greet me (back). It might seem ridiculous but I had to grow up with people constantly letting their anger and frustration out on me, by giving me the silent treatment or by being passive aggressive, by slamming doors and making all kinds of violently loud noises to signal that they were having a bad day and I better not make a single noise or even dare talking to them because that'd only lead to them yelling at me. Never ever would I want to spend the rest of my life walking on eggshells because someone has so little control over their own feelings and emotions. I always try and make sure I don't let people who didn't cause my bad day to be affected by it, and I expect the same from those I choose to surround myself with.

When she was a kitten, she got scared of a remote and almost scratched my eye out. Thankfully, she only scratched into my bottom eyelid, and gave me a permanent second eye bag.

My LDR is so rewarding,"I've been in a LDR with my bf for almost 3 years now and while I of course miss him and wish we were in a more normal relationship, this has been the most rewarding and comforting relationship in my life. 

I was in a pretty toxic and abusive first relationship and honestly wasn't looking for a new partner but my boyfriend kind of just fell into my lap and we've been inseparable since. Even though its LDR, I've always been able to trust him and find such comfort and support with his words and presence. He allows me to make mistakes and learn/fix them as I am mentally able to, but he doesn't let me take advantage of him or his caring nature. He learns about my health issues and ADHD and does his best to work with them while also giving me the courage to tackle them instead of ignoring them.

This post will tell you about my life and how I started loving somebody. Just to keep things private let her call Nexus. It all started in school when I was 15 and she was 14. Yaa I know it is not legal to date or enter into relationship at that age but at that time my intention was not that. We were good friends. We had a school bus through which we used to commute to the school and back to our respective home. I liked the way she talked and it all seemed divine and godly to me whatever she spoke. We had conversation while in the bus and she used to sit with me in bus in the last year of my school in 10th grade. We had conversation on basically everything and that conversation was enough for me to get relaxed after tiring school. I always longed for her presence and I was overjoyed whenever I saw her after a long vacation.  
  
As the time passed, we also grew up and I basically went to a cram school in senior secondary for preparing for entrance examinations in college. My interaction with her decreased and almost reduced to zero during my cram school days. However before the starting of the cram school when the final examination of grade 10 were there, I secretly kept a letter in her bag putting my all the feelings into it and hoped that one day she would see that letter but as there was no name written on that letter just a secret coded name was written, I knew that she would not be able to find out who wrote that. Actually, I never had courage to express my feelings to her directly and even today though I am less hesitant and more expressive than before. However she didn't find that letter in her school bag because it got into one the remotest partition and corner of the bag. However, on the occasion of one of the festival, I visited her house and thinking that this may be the last time I would be able to meet her in the next coming two years, I told her that I have kept a secret letter in her bag but I didn't tell her what I wrote in that letter.  
  
Time passed and after a month or so, again I met her and asked her about that letter. She said she had intuition that I had feelings for her and it was not a great surprise for her. However she respected my expression and accepted another letter I wrote for her. Actually, she used to stay at her home most of the time (except going to school) and at her home there were many elders and it was not safe to discuss and talk about that at her home. Again after a two months, I met her at her home and gave her another letter. I usually used to write what was my state of my mind and what I thought about her. I always consider my love for her as something divine and godly. It was the purest feeling that I ever had and I never ever had dreamt of getting into physical relationship. Nor I believed in the concept of relationship with her but what meant most important for me is her presence and her talks. I could sit and listen to her chit-chats whole day without getting bored.  
  
Now, it was time that my exams approached and I became more and more concentrated about my studies. In 2019, I actually met her once in May on the occasion of her birthday. After that time passed and then CoVID-19 came. She went to another city as her parents' job was transferrable. During the summer of 2020, I contacted her on Instagram and she replied what she thought about the happenings of last 1 or 1 and half a year or so. She said that she respected the expression of mine and was glad that I told her directly rather than getting to know it through others. She said that she didn't have any mood to get into relationship or so.  
  
From that day, I stopped saying that I love her or how much I love her to her directly but my feelings for her got more intense and magnified. Then after a year of silence or so, I again contacted her and this time she got infected by CoVID-19. I prayed day and night for her well being but as I was hundreds of miles away from her, I was literally helpless except praying for her. Then time passed and we had conversation like simple hello, hi, what are you doing, all good and general well being of each other. Actually, it was me who asked for her well being, wished her on special occasions and just texted her. Then comes the time when I went to her city in March 2023. I went to that city just to explore but my main intention was not to explore the city but to see her in person. It had been almost 3 year and 9 months when I last saw her or met her in person. We never had video calls as I thought it would be breach of her privacy or intruding into her space. In March 2023, I met her and that day my heart was filled with joy and fear at the same time. I literally had a electric shock going through my veins. I was not able react to the situation. She was actually tired because of her exams and was not in the mood of talking and it was again it was her house where her elder brother(who is a good friend of mine) and her parents were there. I didn't get the opportunity to talk to her in private as everybody was there. I wanted to have a private chat with her and wanted to directly tell her my feelings once more. But that didn't happened and I returned back to my city.  
  
After that it has been almost 9 months since then and I had same routine of asking for her well-being and wishing her on her birthday and on festivals and special occasions. I don't know what I can do now but It has been almost 8 years and I don't have any clue? I know I can't move on like other Gen-Zs because I love her more than anything else in this world. I have decided that I would never marry or get into any relationship if I couldn't be with her. I know it is painful for me sometimes and often I feel overwhelmed but for me love is not something that you do or change like your clothes. It is the purest feeling for me.

I will be a complete person if she will acknowledge the feeling I have. I love her and that's all I know.  
  
Any suggestions/comments/similar-life experiences/ advice is welcomed. I would love to hear that.

Has the Value of the Kohinoor Increased Due to DeBeers' Popularisation of Diamonds?,"Hey Reddit, had a random shower thought and wanted to pick your brains. I realised that DeBeers, the big name in making diamonds super popular, was founded in 1888, quite a while after the British took possession of the Kohinoor in 1849. This got me wondering – did the Kohinoor become more valuable after DeBeers started hyping up diamonds, or has it always been a hot commodity through history(especially for us Indians)?

Just realized I'm a spinster aunt.,"Today I was thinking about my life, where I am and how far I've come. You know, crap like that. It's true what people say, you're 25 and then suddenly you wake up one morning and you're 40. I don't wonder where the time went, it was hard enough to get through, but still it creeps up on you.

The fact is that I'm almost 40, no kids, unmarried, never even had a relationship. The only difference between me and the stereotype of the aging spinster living on her parents' house is that instead of cats and spinning yarn, it's dogs and 3d printing.

I'm not sure if I'm bitter about it. It's an odd feeling to be past what people consider to be your expiration date with nothing to show for it. I guess I'm fine. It would not have been a good idea for me to have kids for a number of reasons. But you still wonder.

I know I should be happy I made it this far. No one expected me to, me most of all. Well here I am, I guess. Now what?

Sometimes I wonder what reddit would be like if you could disable comments on posts,"I understand why that's not a thing since reddit is a discussion forum and that would defeat the whole purpose of this website, but the idea is just so funny to me.

Like I'm just getting my opinion out there, I'm not interested in anyone else's opinion

I feel like it would be the equivalent of throwing a grenade down a hall and booking it. You know damn well people would abuse the shit out of that. I know I would. I would straight up post things like ""Water is a good substitute for dipping oreos if you don't have milk"" and immediately disable the comments beating people to the punch.

Helping strangers,"I feel so good after helping this old man today, like it’s a sign that life isn’t that bad. (It’s been rough, dawg) but anyways::::
So today I was driving to get lunch, and I had seen an old man w his hood up on his vehicle. And I pulled over and asked him what was wrong and he said that he broke down, and he didn’t have his phone so I offered to have him use my phone to call someone. He’s like 60-70, and he seems upset, he didn’t really take me up on the offer so I asked what happened, and he said that it won’t start, so I asked him to try it so I can hear, sounds like a dead battery, so I offer to give him a jump, and he seemed kind of hesitant, maybe because I’m just a 5 ft 20 yr old girl in a beat up truck.🤣, but he said sure, and then can’t find his jumper cables, I have mine so I pop my hood up & get to business, and the old guy was like, ‘I’m not very mechanically inclined.’ & I replied, ‘I’m not either I just know the colors and they need a good connection’ & I told him to let it sit for a second and his vehicle started. & I asked him how far he has to go & it was like 4 miles. I reversed and pulled to the other side and saw him go on his way. But does helping people make you feel good? Like it made me feel soooooo good, maybe because I’m a ‘girllll’ but like he was so thankful & all I did was start his car for him.

"Hey guys, how's 2024 shaping up for everyone?","Hey folks, how are you all doing? Wanted to share about my week but feel free to skip the following wall of text and tell me about your trials and tribulations. Or any small wins you've had recently. Or ask the wise people of this subreddit for any advice you need. 

So, I have a pretty great life - a wife who loves me (but whom I love even more), a job that pays well (with some of the best colleagues I've ever worked with) and cherry on top, Aussie Open is on. This week should've been a pretty good time. 

What's been primarily bothering me this week is a particular event happening in my country which I find deeply troubling. 

In addition to that, I have made a couple of mistakes at work which could've easily been avoided making me feel embarrassed and with that comes this creeping feeling of incompetence. What makes it worse, is that despite knowing it I didnt fix it in time and it just so happened that one of the colleagues then had to. Which is just so stupid - it makes me cringe at myself. 

As an optimist, I kept thinking - well you'll get through this. You've had worse. Just try to fix your mistakes, look at the opposing perspective - maybe I'm wrong. Wouldn't be the first time. 

What put the nail in the coffin was I had one of the worst nights of my life yesterday. Without getting too graphic, every time I laid down, I was treated to a buildup of phelgm which I made frequent trips to the bathroom... You get it. It was sub-par. 

Tldr; having sub-par week, made mistakes at work, bad snot last night, country going in wrong direction imo",0,1706078775.0,t3_19eayeb
Our next door duplex neighbours scream every other night,"My husband and I bought our first home a few months ago. We bought the third house in a fourplex, so two on one side and then one on the other. Our previous neighbours moved shortly after we did, saying they were renting out their place so they could live out of province. Super lovely and amazing older couple. Now the people that moved in are loud. 

For the first little bit, we didn’t have any issues with them. They never leave their house, never come out unless it’s one of the girl’s boyfriend for a smoke. But it’s progressively gotten bad over time. At one point there was tons of screaming and yelling, that the police were called by one of the girl’s mom’s. The police banged for about 20ish minutes before they went around back and got in. Clearly nothing happened but since then, screaming has gotten worse, banging noises sporadically, screams of genuine pain and anger happen, and today there was screams of pain, sounds of running up and down the stairs and since it’s thinner walls/older home, my husband and I heard the girl screaming for the boyfriend to let her go and stop touching her. Even said to get out of her way, and we’ve heard the door open several times only to be slammed shut and we heard him say she’s not leaving. 

There’s been several instances where the boyfriend is clearly high out of his mind and super drunk. A few times even outside in the back blasting hip hop music, screaming lyrics out and jumping around almost falling off the deck, clearly unstable. 

We’re scared because my husband works 10+ hour days and I’m a student so I’m at home a lot when I’m not at school. I’ve never felt safe with this neighbour, especially lately, and clearly when the police were called nothing happened. It’s hard because the boyfriend is generally nice to my husband when he’s out for a smoke coincidentally. But we’re afraid if we were to say anything to the police or their landlord that it’d be 100% tracked back to us and if nothing happens, who knows what could happen. We’re concerned for the girl and her friend living in there and that in regard to the landlords that destruction of property might be happening. Wondering if anyone has any advice?

UPDATE: Have texted a lengthy message to the landlords and have given them dates/times as to when stuff has happened, including the police being called. Still haven’t heard anything from her and it’s been all day. But earlier this evening I noticed one of the girls and the guy leaving for not even 5 minutes through the back and coming back which is the first I’ve seen of one of the girls.

Does anyone else disqualify themselves from other people on bumble because you have a kind of low opinion of yourself?,"I think I used two different tenses in the question but you get what I mean. It’s just an interesting thing I noticed.

Scrolling down a person’s profile and you’re really into them but you see something like “We’ll get along if… ‘you’re spontaneous and fun!’” and I’m like… welp. I guess I’m pretty bad at those things. 

If I take a hard look at myself, “spontaneous” would be something like ordering from a special restaurant I haven’t tried before on a Saturday night. Seeing a scary movie, but in theatres this time. Going to a town 45 minutes over on a whim on a Saturday morning and a home made coffee in my thermos to get a special kind of yarn for a trinket I want to make for a friend.  

I know, oooh! Ahhh! Slow down, right?

So I’m just honest with myself and swipe no for them, even though I’m almost doing so on their behalf for me not meeting their standards. If I knew they’d for sure like me, I’d swipe yes. 

I actually realized too I hope other people wouldn’t do the same if we switched positions. Just because I might say I like spontaneity (I don’t have that as a thing I’d put on my profile but whatever), it doesn’t mean that I’d want someone else to think they’re too boring to swipe right on me.

Have u ever felt the need to stop comparing yourself to others ??,"

I'm 18F . I'm a college student( medical) . Comparing myself to others has been a recent problem of mine from the last 1 year. I just got my results from the annual exam that i wrote. I did not fail any of them . But I didn't get the expected percentage that i wanted . And my other classmates who don't even study that much passed in a higher percentage than of mine . And I'm not looking down on those people but I can see that they don't work hard as much as me . So i thought should I work harder now? but I don't want to give up all the enjoyments in life just for studies, even if I did I'm not gonna be happy , i know that . I want to know how to balance my self. 

I am the type of person who feels that I am worthless if I don't achieve what I wanted to. I just lose interest in everything and sometimes i find it hard to eat because I don't feel worthy of even eating.

Aimed at people who moved to South Korea: How have you adapted to SK? Biggest surprises and challenges?,"Hello everyone! This is my first post on Reddit, but I've been a lurker for many years.

I'm a swedish dude who moved to South Korea about a year ago and I really enjoy it here! The food is delicious, the people generally welcoming. But from what I've been told, lots of people around me expected that I'd have a really hard time.

There's definitely a culture clash of sorts, but for me the biggest is simply living near Seoul. So many people and tall buildings compared to Sweden. Language barrier is still a problem, sure, but not an insurmountable one.

What about you guys? Having difficulty adapting at all? Anything that took you by surprise? Was something much easier/harder than you expected?

How can i eat a healthy vegetarian diet on a budget and fast to make?,"So i'm considering going full vegetarian. I cut out a lot of meat like beef and pork because meat makes me sick. But i'll have something chicken about 2-3 times a week mainly because it's cheap. And chicken was one of the meat that affected me the least, still affects me but only a little. Now it's starting to make me feel just about the same.

RN what meals i do eat are pretty unhealthy. Boxed pastas, frozen cheese pizzas, that unhealthy. I'll eat veggies and fruit like peas, broccoli, corn, bananas, etc.

But thing is i tried to look for some recipes to maybe try to replace them but a lot are expensive here. Things like expensive squash, seeds, etc. Or they take a really long time to make.

I cut all my “friends” out of my life,"I just cut everyone out. Majority of them are toxic and took advantage of me (been with them for years before I got the courage to end things or distance myself), one doesn’t like me as much as I thought but keeps me around for whatever reason so I distanced myself and two I just don’t vibe with. This always happens with me and I’m exhausted to make anymore friends. It’s so tiring. Maybe I’m the problem at this point…..

Maybe it’s better for me to not make anymore friends. And I have this issue of not being able to leave if I have been friends with them for years. This is why I like keeping new people at a distance so I can quietly leave if need be. Sometimes with people I have known for a long time, I start replying to them less. I don’t ignore but I just distance myself until they get the hint because I’m a coward. 

I don’t want friends but than I do want friends but it feels like something just goes wrong every single time. Either their toxic, don’t really like me, or they like me but I don’t like them, or there’s something that they do that I don’t tolerate or they do something that make them seem disingenuous and than I can’t trust them. Maybe I’m picky…. I’m so sorry. 

And it used to take me at least four years to see their true colours….. cause I’m so delusional. Or they change up on me after four years or so…. This is why I’m so paranoid when it comes to new people. Y’all I’m pathetic. Idk if I’ll regret it but I realized I don’t like being around any of them.",0,1706060228.0,t3_19e56a4

Next time I buy a new loofah, I'll probably get a purple one so it's on theme.

It's about a robbery and a big robbery. I don't know any people at all and i don't know where it started. There was a plan and we went ahead then we have to cross this border via rail so there was checkup inside some building. And also for robbery there was a lotta people involved and weirdly some dolls similiar looking ever at size smaller than my finger dolls.then we go ahead across border. Maybe we complete robbey and come back and while coming back there was this big bomb attached to the last bogey of train and rail track creating friction. Also before that we were all in a room where when I went to chel up luggage I saw those dolls in a small box I talked about, all in red dress. Also about that bomb is that we if we stop the train the bomb will touch the ground n we'll all explode. and at last distance our train starts to stop idk why so we go to the bomb and pull it while the train is running to maontain the friction. The bomb starts to get red but I don't remember what happens to the bomb. But I do remember that train stops and in the station and 3 of us (all boys) are across this big lake we have to swin and some people involved in robbery already crossed it. So I go first then those to also starts to swin and while swimming I get so sleepy and starts to sleep and drown. But after hearing their voices I wake up in the water and starts swimming again. After we reach other side of lake we had to go through checkup so we do in this big facility. I do remember sending our bag for checkup after reaching other side of lake. So after checkup we are in this room together at our station and one of the guy vomitss so badly that I dont take that well and starts to sing and spit in basin (also i remember there was a basin for every guy and aside of every locker). The thing is I clearly remember what i sing ""ohh motha fuckar ohhhh motha fuckar and when I spit in dream I also spit in real life lmao. So I feel liquid n woke up.

Quitting something because you're afraid,"Has anyone quit anything (not necessarily a job) because they were too scared, or not cut out for something, even though they still kind of want to do the said thing? I’m feeling dejected, silly, and stupid all at the same time, and I am wondering if anyone has felt something similar. 

My husband and I have skied five times; we took a beginner lesson last year. We started out at a very small, rural resort. We have only skied the bunny hill and the one green trail that they offer. Last Sunday we checked out a different, larger resort.  We are not comfortable with blue runs yet; we had all intentions to stick to the different green trails.

We started out at their smallest green trail, which was great! Let me preface this by saying that getting off the chair lift scares me! I have yet to master getting off a chair lift. The chair lift for this first trail was relatively easy; I fell the first time, but then got the hang of it on the second go around. We got in a few runs and had a great morning. 

Then we went to another green slope. Here's where the fun stopped... The slope while getting off the chair lift was super steep. I saw it two seconds before getting off and said, ""Oh no..."" My husband and I both wiped out. I came down hard and I'm certain I bruised, maybe even fractured my tailbone. So then, in a lot of pain and wiping the tears away, we then had to try to ski down that slope, which felt a lot more like a blue, even black, in our books. We managed the first half of the slope, but then it evened out before dropping off to, what felt like to us, a cliff! I ended up taking my skis off and walked down. My husband managed to get down, but he said he was not comfortable at all. 

It definitely put a damper on our day. We did get some more runs in down the first green trail, but I was so fearful after our earlier experience that the fun was gone. 

I feel like I could ski the smallest slope 150 times, and I’d still be too scared to go on that other chair lift and “green” trail. One fall off that particular chair lift the wrong way, and I could be seriously be injured. How are people supposed to progress and advance??? 

Why do chair lifts have to be the way they are? Why can’t all ski lifts be a j-bar or a t-bar? Why can’t chair lifts stop completely for a second or two, for you to ski off a flat section?  (Skiers, please be nice. I’m frustrated, and mostly just speaking hyperbolically at this point.) 

I am wondering if the anxiety, being fearful of the chair lift, being scared of injuries, and dealing with the injuries themselves is even worth it anymore. By the time I’m at the bottom of a run, I’m thinking, ‘Oh no, time to face the chair lift again.’ I’m seriously considering trying cross country skiing next year instead. I live in a cold, snowy area, and the whole point of trying skiing was to find more joy in the wintertime. 

I am so mad and upset at myself because I had these silly visions of getting better and better at skiing, taking ski vacations, etc. We had wanted to try a third ski resort, but now I don’t want to because I don’t know what the chair lift is like. I don’t want to be seen as a quitter. I feel like it’s one thing to put yourself out of your comfort zone (taking the ski lesson) but why should someone have to go through something that absolutely terrifies them? 

I had thought of just continuing to ski the bunny slope and the two greens we know for all time, but is it worth it? I’m still scared of the smaller chair lifts. 

Has anyone else gone through something remotely similar? I’d be surprised if a skier managed to come across this post.

What is at the heart of maintaining a healthy relationship?,"At the heart of any healthy social relationship lies a two-way recognition, that is, both parties see something in each other and appreciate it from the heart as a precious trait.

This rule applies to any intimate relationship, parent-child, friend, coworker, and any social object on which a relationship needs to be built.

If one day you no longer feel this kind of recognition from the other person, it also signals the end of the relationship, or at least it is no longer healthy, does not empower you, but instead drains your energy every now and then, and in my opinion is no longer worth maintaining. It's important to differentiate between this kind of recognition and the compliments that are given on a whim though.",0,1706018425.0,t3_19dp1vq

"Have you witnessed an odd ""honeymoon phase"" when meeting some people?","I'm not talking dating but just normal socializing. You meet some people and immediately they go out of their way to impress you, seek validation, overshare, excessive compliments, insist on spending time with you, use labels like ""best friend"" prematurely, mirror you, say what you want to hear etc etc and bam, out of the blue, all of that's gone. I haven't been able to tell if they're faking or if this is involuntary for them. The closest I can think of is it's the platonic version of lovebombing

And by itself there is nothing wrong with eg. oversharing. We all do it from time to time, but when it's a part of a underlying pattern is when it feels odd.

I've done a lot of work on myself to be authentic and I'm mostly the same person from the very beginning, so from my point of view this drastic fluctuation sticks out even more. And it makes me not take them seriously, and instead wait it out to see if they're real. And it takes a few days or weeks for them to come down from this... fever that fades away as quickly as it developed

I have always wanted to have the sense of belonging that comes with having a (large) friend group and I'm thinking about the reasons why this has eluded me.,"When I was a kid, I didn't really ''put effort into'' making friends because my family had a lot of REALLY close friends who had children that I basically grew up with. When I'm with these ''kids'' (we're adults now lol) that's the only time I get this sense of family and belonging. It feels like the connection that we have between one another is special. For better or worse, a chunk of us don't live in the same countries so we only get to do this 2-3 times a year.

In school, I was never part of friend groups because I felt like these people were trying to act ''cool'' for having a lot of friends. (What does that even mean?? 😃) I had individual friends but not a clique.

In university, I was markedly older than my peers and I really didn't feel like I had anything in common with them. I did make two close friends for life there but that's that.

In almost 10 years of work I have never made a single friend with whom I would hang out after hours. I'm very introverted at work even though I'm quite extroverted ''IRL''. Always a desk job, always with people significantly older than me, always with people who I did not feel like I can relate with. I had a girlfriend from work once but that's that. I have definitely started to work on this after I had a conversation about it with my mother - she was/is also like that - very very rarely clicks with the people she works with. I have put in some effort to be more present in the office even though she has SO MANY FRIENDS outside work. At the end of the day this one is probably on me.

I think I am very good at 1 on 1 conversations. I believe I am an interesting person to talk to. I can go to a bar or social event alone and I will almost instantly find someone to talk to without being intruisive. Example: when I went to a corporate team building event in 2022. Over 200 people. I arrived around 6 in the evening and up until 6 in the morning I had long and meaningful conversations (probably an hour or so) with about 10 different people whom I hadn't met before. This begs the question - why didn't this lead to anything further? Why didn't I actually become friends with any of these people? 

I know that 99% of friend groups need to have a common environment where comradery can flourish. You basically can't pick random people off the street and ''create'' a friend group, there needs to be something to keep them together and in contact. 

I have (had) friend ''''''''groups''''''''' of 3-4-5 people but that doesn't give me the sense of belonging that I'm talking about.

Here is what I have identified so far as my potential shortcomings:

1. I'm passive. I think this is the biggest and most significant one. Be the change that you want to see in the world. I could organize stuff with people and not just wait for them to happen. The social things that I do have almost always been someone asking/inviting me to go somewhere/ do something, almost never initiated by me.

2. Maybe I'm delusional? Maybe I'm not as interesting or likeable as I think I am? Maybe I dominate conversations too much? I definitely don't have the need to be liked by everyone so I don't suck up to people and I'm fine with someone not being my fan so idk about that... I don't think it's true but... maybe?

3. I like having the attention on me in a way that the flow of the conversation is not interrupted. Maybe that's why I (think I) flourish in 1 on 1 conversations - people are not distracted. I have their undivided attention and there is no jumping from topic to topic the way that it often happens with group conversations. I like to be heard.

4. My interests have almost always been ones that do not require other people. idk... cubing, true crime, chess, science and general knowledge stuff, etc. etc.



I've started going to BJJ now and I hope that with consistency I could be able to make friends there and potentially insert myself somehow as I like a couple of the guys over there but who knows? I'm going to the office more often, I'm trying to organize more stuff with my (individual 😀) friends.

It's possible that I'm chasing flying pigs. I'm looking for a group of people to be part of my identity the way my childhood friends are most certainly a very important part of who I am as a person and that's simply unattainable.

What’s your motivation to get out of bed today?,"My chronic illness has left me home bound for the last couple days.

I kinda hate how my friends don't talk about the movie we just saw at the cinema for more than two minutes after it ends,"I have a couple friends I go to the cinema with around once every month or two.

What I like to do after a movie ends and the credits roll up is to sit there a minute or two, just to think about what I just watched. My friends, however, act like we're going to be charged an extra fee for sitting there a little longer or something, because they stand up literally the second the movie ends.

Then, as soon as we start walking towards the exit, they immediately start talking about anything else, such as their jobs or the economy. And when we have dinner right afterwards, the movie doesn't come up. I'm often like, ""Dude, we just spent 2+ hours watching the film, surely you can spare a few minutes to talk about it?"", and only then we talk about it a little.

It's not that it bothers me *too* much, but still, I feel it's kind of a waste to spend money to watch a movie at the cinema together, only to not talk about it after. Especially since they're often the ones to suggest we go watch a movie they're interested in!",0,1706000051.0,t3_19dk4c5

What are some of the most underrated movies that you love?,"Hi everyone, I hope you are having a great day. I’m a huge movie buff and I love watching all kinds of films, from classics to indie gems. But sometimes I feel like some movies don’t get the recognition or appreciation they deserve, either because they are overshadowed by more popular ones, or because they are misunderstood or misjudged by critics or audiences.
So I wanted to ask you, what are some of the most underrated movies that you love? Movies that you think are brilliant, but not many people have seen or heard of, or movies that you think are unfairly criticized or overlooked. And why do you love them? What makes them special or unique to you?
I’ll start with a few of my favorites:
The Fall (2006): This is a visually stunning and emotionally moving fantasy adventure film, directed by Tarsem Singh and starring Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru. It’s about a hospitalized stuntman who tells a fantastical story to a young girl, using the people and objects around him as inspiration. The story is shown in vivid colors and breathtaking locations, while the reality is shown in muted tones and bleak settings. The film explores the power of imagination, storytelling, and friendship, and it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I’ve ever seen. It’s a hidden gem that deserves more attention and praise.
The Prestige (2006): This is a mind-blowing and twisty thriller, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. It’s about two rival magicians who compete to create the ultimate illusion, while sacrificing everything in their obsession. The film is full of surprises, secrets, and revelations, and it keeps you guessing until the very end. It’s a masterful and clever film that explores the themes of obsession, rivalry, sacrifice, and identity. It’s one of Nolan’s best films, in my opinion, and it’s often overlooked by his other more famous works.
The Truman Show (1998): This is a brilliant and original comedy-drama, directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey. It’s about a man who discovers that his entire life is a reality TV show, and that everyone he knows is an actor. The film is a satire of the media, consumerism, and the human condition, and it raises some interesting questions about free will, reality, and identity. It’s also a showcase of Carrey’s dramatic range, as he portrays a man who goes from blissful ignorance to existential crisis. It’s a film that is both funny and poignant, and it’s one of my all-time favorites.

I've been thinking a lot recently about those posts where people say that if they were sent back in time, they would be too dumb to be able to help advance society in any way. Or, maybe they just don't know how things work very well.

I just had a song truly speak to me for the first time in years.,"[Television's Marquee Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4myghLPLZc) if you want to follow along at home

So I'm working at home today--icy roads. I'm relatively new at this job, but it's one that you know will just always be tedious. And for me, I don't think I've had a job I actually liked. There's nothing I want to have to do for the rest of my days except play music, go walking around, hiking, etc. I know it's all anyone wants, but I have difficulties rationalizing how much of my life I'll spend sitting in an office.

But anyways, I'm working, and my manager gives me something to do. Something mindless, an hour or so of basically data entry. I say okay, pull out my speaker and throw on *Marquee Moon* (the album). I've heard this bad boy plenty of times, so I figured it'd be easy enough to have in the background while I'm doing what I'm supposed to be. 

Then four songs in, on comes the ten minute opus. I don't think much of it for a while, until the verse about the Cadillac and the graveyard come on and it grabs me like it never has before. From there every word was sung from my mouth, every note of that long solo played from my guitar. Took me the rest of the song to be able to get back to work. I listen to and love a lot (a *lot*) of music, but feeling it on this level is... I still feel like my insides are reverberating metal, it's such a weird sensation.

I tried to think of the last time something like this happened, and think it's the first time in around five years (that one was [The Ballad of the Costa Concordia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v533tMdOyY), which was my depressed & hungover song senior year of college, lol)

I'm not sure what to do about this, if anything, but it's such an incredible feeling that I needed to share.

I make up fictional words with enough frequency that Google Docs has given up trying to correct me when I make a made up word.,"I think it's pretty funny actually because when I misspell a real word the Google AI is sophisticated enough that it understands the context and knows I was trying to spell a real word. I know some of you might be skeptical but there is a definite difference in how the autocorrect works on my different Google accounts. My main account that I do most of my writing on is the one in particular that this occurrence happens. On my professional account which I do very little of my own creative writing the autocorrect is much more strict. 

I've also noticed that different Google products/services have different spellcheckers than another. Google docs, Google drive, Chrome, all have different spell checkers. I can tell a difference between docs and Chrome's spellchecker because Chrome will sometimes autocorrect words that docs wouldn't correct even if I was just previously using those same words. Then there's drive's spellchecker which is really bad actually, it not only autocorrects many words that aren't commonly used but it also is just kinda sh!@#ty in general and will often try to autocorrect uncommon or obscure words.

I feel like I'm unintentionally shilling here for Google but their products/services are pretty incredible despite any criticism the company itself might receive. I might just be in my 30s but even I'm starting to say things like back in my day it was a Godsend when things like Microsoft Word came out with even the most basic spellchecker. Now not only are modern spellcheckers better at correcting spelling and grammar than I am they're also so sophisticated that they can also write better than I can. 

I also remember when it was our grandparents who were unfamiliar with computers when they would try to give their computers commands like saying, ""okay computer go to my son's Facebook"" and we'd be like silly gran/gramps computers don't work that way. And now that's exactly how computers are starting to work. Who knows, maybe it'll get to the point that every digital device will have its own AI installed and soon we'll be in a day and age where the concept of technology without AI will be akin to how foreign it is to imagine modern life without electricity.",0,1705951265.0,t3_19d3t4m
I stopped celebrating Valentine's Day when I was 13. And now I don't know how I can give my current S/O the best Valentine's ever.,"It all started in Second Grade.
I loved Valentine's Day. I loved the color pink.
But there a bully in my class that hated my guts for some odd reason. 
So on the day of the Valentine's Day party, I brought Valentine's for everyone except that bully.
The bully tattle-taled to the teacher, and I tried to tell her, ""He bullies me. He doesn't get a Valentine.""
The teacher didn't care if he was a bully. ""Valentine's Day  and giving out Valentine's means friendship for EVERYONE."" She told me. ""If you don't give Kyle (fake name) a Valentine, then you will not participate in the Valentine's Day class party."" 
So begrudgingly, I gave the stupid fucking bully a stupid fucking Valentine. 

Then came Third Grade. 
I tried to be ""the bigger person"", and give my bullies a Valentine.
But one of the bullies ripped up my Valentine, because ""Winnie the Pooh is for stupid, r-worded whiner babies"". 

Then came middle school, and the onset of puberty. 
I crushed on this boy who looked like a very tall Jonathan Brandi's. 
But he didn't return my affections at all, nor would he voice his rejection. In other words, I was lead on.
No Valentine's from him. No Valentine's from anyone, other than one girl that was my friend at the time.
In 7th Grade, I asked said boy (we'll call him ""Kenny"") to this co-ed Valentine's Dance a my middle school.
He said that he would go to the dance.
But he never showed up.
I was wearing a skirt and a clean shirt too. 
But Kenny never showed up, and I ended up leaving the dance an hour early, while crying my eyes out, and eating a lot of ice cream while watching the 2010 winter Olympics.

After that, I stopped celebrating Valentine's Day altogether, much to the chagrin of my family. 

And I haven't celebrated Valentine's Day in almost 15 years. 

And now that I have an S/O as an adult, I don't know how to give them the best Valentine's Day, because I never celebrated Valentine's Day with anyone special in my life.

TL;DR: Haven't celebrated Valentine's Day in ages, now need a refresher course",0,1705946677.0,t3_19d1xrv
Do you feel sorry for objects too?,"These days I went to the market and needed two bags of flour. There were three on the shelf. I took the two bags I needed and when I was leaving, the thought came ""that bag that is left will feel inferior to the ones chosen"" and now I have three bags of flour but I have a clear conscience! And after this episode I realized that this type of thinking is very recurring for me. Is it just me or does anyone else think this way (do they feel compassion or pity for objects or things)?

Getting rejected from courses,"UK resident here (20f). I’ve been in administration for almost 3 years, so my boss thought it would be a good idea for me to take a course in the hopes that I can further my career in that field and provide more for the company. Either courses take a year to complete, or they’re extortionately expensive—I only need a little, couple month course for a certificate! Jeez.

Anyway, I found some great ones that fit the bill. Applied for them. Got an email back saying I didn’t qualify because I only had two GCSEs. I explained my situation, “I had issues in school, so I was homeschooled and we couldn’t afford the rest of the tests.” They practically hung up on me.

This has happened twice now, and it’s so disheartening—I never thought that part of my life would stunt my chances at a post-College age in furthering my education. I know I’m not stupid, but it makes me feel like I am. For entry courses like that… you can’t improve your education if your previous education is inadequate. It just doesn’t make sense.",0,1705944998.0,t3_19d18lt

Recipes are why people hate cooking,"Cooking from a recipe involves researching what you want, finding a recipe which looks good and you can make, and shopping for the specific ingredients. In the end, unless you know some basic cooking techniques the result isn't as good as you expected, and you end up with excess ingredients that slowly accumulate until you have to throw them out.  It's just too much effort for too little reward. However, if you know some basic cooking skills and don't need to look up most recipes, then cooking is a breeze. Just mindlessly toss some things together and in half the time of reading/following instructions you can get something twice as good.

What you need is not more water (aka more stimulation) but to repair the bucket (aka heal your inner wounds) and you will realize you never needed so much water to have a fully filled bucket (aka be fulfilled).

Unfortunately, what most people do is to increase the water pressure and thus eventually destroy the bucket more and more and more.

The word ‘argument’ shows that we as a species have evolved to accept the concept of a ‘heated’ discussion as inherently ‘negative’.,"This is because the word ‘argument’ can be used as either,

A. A thesis, put forth to others to make the person’s point in the discussion

B. ‘A row’, shouting, aggressive, confrontational, disagreement in very extreme ways, to the point of anger

Surely a mature civilisation would view the concept of an ‘argument’ to be wholly positive, because it means there is vibrant and lively discourse all the time, on massive scale about how to continue to improve the Nirvanic society we have evolved to, and keep it getting better. Therefore, the word just wouldn’t be associated with an alternative meaning which has overtones of aggression and violence.

I am genuinely convinced the BP gas station near my work is a front.,"So, near the place where I work, there’s this BP gas station. When I started working there during Covid, it had the gas prices around that time, but the windows were boarded up. So even though the gas pumps were on and there were cars in the parking lot, the place looked abandoned.

Then last year in Fall, the boards were torn down, but the gas price was changed. Changed to $6.49 per Gallon for Normal, and $0.08 for Diesel. What the hell? Even weirder is that the parking lot had only about 2 cars and no customers. You’d think diesel trucks would jump on the opportunity. And then night would come, and they would become busy with a bunch of black cars filled with people speaking Spanish.

Finally, last week, the prices of gas were returned to normal, but the black cars still show up at night. Seems they got legit air pumps for tires now, though. The people in the cars seem pissed at the workers, and they just yell at them in Spanish.

I was stuck in a loop of waking up into a different dream until the alarm went off and woke me up for real,"I woke up today at around 6am and so I thought I'd just go back to sleep since I'm working from home today and tired from yesterday. As I was asleep, I got another one of those normal dreams where I was home doing whatever, and then all of a suddent, in that dream, I woke up in my current place, looked at the clock on my phone and it turned out it's 11:00 AM, which is 3 hours late, my colleagues left a few absent calls as well, I was like I'm screwed. 

I went to the bathroom to take a shower like I do on Mondays, and someone left a bag of chips and TUCs on the sink? I realized I was in a dream. 

I became sentient in my dream and I realized I had to wake the f up. So I lteterally went back into my bed and went back to sleep. Woke up in another dimension, this one was industrial, my sister was with me, the f we were doing there? No idea. We were walking around and talking crap like we always do. 

Went back to sleep, woke up downtown, an Asian-looking good came to me and asked me something about Morrocan accent, as the girl next to me was answering, he disappeared. 

And it happened one more time. 

Until the alarm took off and I woke up ahaha, no idea what planet or dimension I would've ended up on ahd the alarm not gone off. ",0,1705916103.0,t3_19crxeo
Reddit needs an indicator if attached images are a slideshow.,"Maybe this says more about me, but I wouldn’t bother looking at a post if the attachment is multiple images. It’s one tap too many for me. But there’s no way (that I can see) if a post is one image or multiple. It would be easy for Reddit to let you know with a little icon or something, and maybe I’m alone here, but I’d appreciate knowing ahead of schedule.

"Why I don't like researching history anymore, A. K. A., why I'm not a history nerd anymore","Ever since I was 8 or 9 or such until I was about 15 or 16, I LOVED history, I would watch videos discussing various aspects of history and read history books all the time, and it mattered a lot to me, history classes and such were my favorite classes at school, I crushed them, I would surprise my friends and family with random facts, my family and I would watch Jeopardy and I would get giddy when a historical subject or question would pop up, but as we all know, some messed up stuff happened in the past, I won't deny that, and you wouldn't either, but after a while, all of the darker historical facts destroyed my mental health, I was worried that Thomas Hobbes was right, if you know what I mean, I know I sound like a softie and a naive woman-child, but it can get too much for anyone learning about stuff like this, I agree that we should learn about some of these events, but most of the time, there's just so much bad things that happened, and the phrase ""Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it"" somewhat enrages me, as not EVERYTHING that has every happened in history is necessarily mandatory to learn about, that would be a lifetime's worth of learning, and hearing people say ""everyone was evil and cruel in past"" as stuff was the final straw, emphasizing the EVERYONE part, even the average Joe and Jane? I find philosophies like those of Hobbes to be comically pessimistic and angsty, I don't agree with his idea, it's not like when you pop out of the womb you stab your mom or something, things happen that lead to cruel and evil stuff to happen, so the TLDR is that I'm not a history nerd anymore as learning about a lot of things that has happened in the past has ruined my mental health, and after so long learning so much dark facts, I have had enough, so I have pretty much abandoned my love of history, I know this all sounds silly, but if you were in my shoes, you'd understand why.",0,1705907382.0,t3_19cpx7d

Please! I need advice!,"My mother got a new boyfriend before Christmas.

He was already moved in to my mom's place and putting money down on an engagement ring a couple weeks into the relationship.

I wouldn't care because it's my mom's life. However, my 6 year old child stays at her house sometimes.

I was upset the last time my son went right before Christmas. That's how I found out about my mother's ""friend"". Who she lied and said was a friend then come to find out over a text message that she's engaged.

Back then I told my mom that I'm not comfortable with a stranger sleeping in the same house as my kid when I'm not there and that I wanted to meet him first.

So my mother decided that he wouldn't be a stranger anymore, I moved all my Christmas Day plans so I could go to her place and meet him.

I went and he didn't show. I stayed an hour later because ""he was on his way"" but he never showed.

Fast forward to last week and my mother and this guy broke up over Facebook!

So thinking the guy was gone, I sent my son over to my mother's. When my son got dropped off yesterday, my mother showed up at my house with this man and wanted to bring him in my house!

Now mind you she drove almost an hour. Never told me he was there. Never told me she was bringing him over. So they show up and my hair was in the middle of being dyed, no bra, not appropriate. And guess what else?

Now my husband and I are fighting because my husband was pissed that I would allow my son to be with a stranger...

So my question is... the advice I'm desperately seeking... is what do I do about my mother?

My husband thinks I should cut her out completely. My sister [also her daughter], thinks I need to have a good talking to with her and that should be fine.

I can honestly say, I'm pissed.

Does anyone think we are now getting shorter/smaller rather than taller?,"
This is just a bit of an observation me and a co worker noticed in my industry. I work in the energy sector in a gas turbine plant, often in the PPE stores, and it seems over the last few years or so overall requests and saftey boot requests have been getting smaller rather than bigger. I know many keep going on about how much taller and stuff we are getting as each generation passes, but I don’t see it to be honest? Have we maybe plateaued off now? 

When I first started working here back in 2013 or so a size 11 to 13 safety boot was extremely common in the guys who had been working here 20 plus years. I would say this size range was basically almost always the standard size request for most of the blokes on site. 

Now lot of those guys have retired or left the the industry a d this next generation, Gen Z, are starting to come to work with us and its like sizes 7 to 9 UK seems to be the norm for these new guys.

It’s the same for safety overalls too we get way smaller size requests than the sizes we used to be ordering 10 to 13 years back. 

We have like 20 somethings starting which look like high schoolers.

To the current/future fresh graduates who are searching for jobs.,"If ever they are available to you, use networking/connections of your parents/relatives/friends after four months of job hunting and getting rejected. I never had the privilege of using connections as I got my job straight out of internship but I'm saying the job market now is tough. You will face tons of rejections even from dream companies and it can take quite a while to get a good entry-level position. That is why you have your parent’s networks or connections to help you get in, if you have them. I still want you to try getting in by yourself but the networks/connections should only be for after four months. It will give an impression you used every resource available. If you use those networks on the first day of job hunting, I will see you as privileged because it makes you seem dependent on your parents. Get help from your parents once you run out of options or are exhausted.  
  
Yes you may get some flak and some toxic vibes, especially from the HR and some employees about how you got in (since some of these people never had connections in the first place) but remember that they would have done the same if they had those networks. That is why I never get mad at someone who gets in that way even if I never did it, because I would have done so if I did have those resources. Once you get into an entry-level job, this is when you stop using your parent’s connections and take it from there.

"I got my Driver's License 20 years ago, and then never drove once again","I passed my driving exam and got my license 20 years ago, and then never drove again! Kind of strange, I know.

Primarily I've always had a fear of driving, traffic is scary. People are texting while driving and drifting out of their lane. There's a lot of road rage out there, and a lot of people who drive dangerously. 

Also I could never afford a vehicle or car insurance anyways, but I'm sure I could have borrowed my parents' car from time to time if I wanted to, which I didn't.

But I bring this up because I'm going to try and get back into driving now, as scary as it still seems...it's very difficult to be a functional adult in this country (US) without being able to drive. I could Bike, but that's just as dangerous if not more dangerous that driving. Plus it gets to be 110 degrees here in Arizona, and biking in that heat doesn't sound fun.

So even though I can legally drive now, I definitely need a refresher on all the traffic rules/laws, and then I need to take small steps like driving around in an empty parking lot, and eventually getting a driver instructor (hopefully they are better than my first one, who was mean and made me lose any little confidence that I had at the time).

It's tough to get over a fear you've had for so long, but I think it could really be beneficial to my life. I wouldn't have to bug other people to try and get a lift somewhere any time I had an appointment or needed some groceries or whatever.

So I'm definitely *not* looking forward to it, but my therapist really wants me to, and my family really want me to drive. It's going to be frightening for sure, but I think I can do it. 

Not many people in their late 30s are trying driving for basically the first time!

Changing your ways and breaking free,"Hello everyone!

Proud to say this is my first post on reddit! After years of just lurking on reddit, then uninstalling it to try and break free from the obsessive mindless scrolling, to now finally reinstall it, make my first post and feel like I have a purpose to be here.

I would like to share so much of what is going on right now in my life, and I hope I will over the coming weeks, months, or even years. The feeling of real happiness about life comes way too seldom for me, and this time I'm aiming to take advantage of it for real.

It's all quite paradoxical really, just a few days ago I decided to end my relationship with my girlfriend. It wasn't due to any dramatic reasons, our cooperation in everyday life was quite solid. However I had more and more come to realise that we were quite different when it comes to ""what makes one tick"", to give a very short explanation.

Anyway, the current feeling is freedom; freedom to do whatever I want, wherever I want. I want to change my ways from being a relatively shy person mostly hanging around at home (which also was the case in my previous relationship), to a person who is keen to experience new things with likeminded people. I want to be part of a community where I feel like people see me. Someday I want to find that someone who I can love and share my life with, have kids and be the best father I can possibly be.

However, this is all just in my head at the moment. I've previously had many similar moments of sudden bursts of euphoria, and those times it all just stayed in my head until it cooled down and, ultimately, ended in me going back to my previous ways of living. This time I actually want to act upon these feelings I'm having, and enact some change in my life, and hopefully spread some positivity in the directions of others along the way.

Has anyone else here had these kinds of ""aha"" moments and acted upon them? If so, please share how this journey looked for you, and any tips you have for me to actually break free this time, and live life to its fullest.",0,1705871425.0,t3_19cdvwh

Most people drink at parties not because they can’t have fun without booze - but because other people can’t have fun without it,"Many people like to think they can have fun no matter what the party / event but i think they are lying to themselves.  

Having fun is a choice, but it can also depend on other factors like your surrounding environment or the people around you. When it comes to social settings: (particularly large events like weddings/engagement parties/work parties), many people drink; not because of dependancy or wanting to get drunk - but because it makes other people more interesting. 

I’ve seen a lot of shade on Reddit towards people who want to drink to enhance their fun.   
Criticisms like: “these types of people have a problem” or are “ alcoholics” or “sad” are thrown around so flippantly. 

These criticisms makes me wonder if the people who criticise people for wanting a drink understand that some people just love enjoy the taste and because it’s a nice treat at the end of the week to get that boost/buzz.

The people criticising say things like ""I can have fun without drinking""  implies that fun can just happen out of thin air regardless of our surroundings and doesn’t take into account the fact that many people are very socially awkward/ private or straight up BORING. 

Some people are naturally reserved because of their upbringing. Drinking makes them connect with a sillier part of themselves. One that is free and less inhibited. I think this is why many people are dependant on drinking at parties. It makes them more confident. 

Then there are others who are naturally bubbly, curious and extroverted. They don’t need alcohol to have fun. But it they are at an event where people don’t open up or are good conversationalists - that is when alcohol becomes a great staple.   


Sometimes, people need booze to have fun (not because they are boring) but because other people are boring

"We should value life for its immensity, not for its usefulness","I was in a science lecture. The lecturer was telling some facts that were found during a certain experiment. At one point this random guy stood up and asked “But what’s the use of this?”.There was no immediate application but that doesn’t mean that it was useless. Science doesn’t mean exploitation It's fundamentally exploration.

  
This question intrigued me, and I really wanted to ask him, ""What's the use of you?"" because we are born, and there's no inherent purpose for our existence. Without us, the planet would be more pristine, and so would the galaxies, yet we continue to live. I didn't say anything because I realized I am also like him. Whenever I did anything, I always questioned myself, ""What's the use of this?""

  
That was the point of self-reflection. I realized this clearly when I read this quote in scientist David Orr's book ""The plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers, and lovers of every kind. It needs people who live well in their places.""

  
I decided to change & go with the flow of life. I found myself enjoying my friends' spare time, creating moments with family, volunteering in various activities, and it gave me more peace within myself. Rightly said by Sadhguru ‘There is no use to life. We value life for its beauty, exuberance, profoundness, and intensity, not for its usefulness’

Just looking for info on how to kill mosquitoes under my house,"Hey, this is potentially not the right sub (if it's not, can any of you guys point me to the right one if you know it?) but I have a huge problem with mosquitoes. It's summer here in Aus and I'm SERIOUSLY swarmed by mozzies every night when I try to sit outside on my wooden deck.

The deck is basically a large box made of wooden slabs, about 4 metres by 4 metres worth of floor space, and the box itself is about 2 metres high. So, when we go out onto the deck, we're on TOP of that box. Under the box's ""ceiling"" (which we stand on) is a dark space built on top of untreated dirt. I do not know why the previous home owners built it this way tbh, but I know it was their ""creation"". 

The issue, as I've said, is that every evening we are absolutely MURDERED by mosquitoes any time we try to use the deck. I physically cannot use the space for more than about 30-45 seconds before I get at least one bite - it truly is THAT FUCKING BAD. I sat out there for 6 minutes and 52 seconds this evening at ~20:00, and in that time I got FIFTEEN FUCKING BITES. I am being eaten alive, it's impossible to use.

What the fuck do I do?! Is there a chemical I can use to make the space under it absolutely unliveable for mosquito kind? Is there something I can do to make it inhospitable - maybe covering the dirt or treating the dirt under it?

Y'all, I'm at a loss. I'm not an entomologist, I know shit-all about insects tbh, so I have no idea. We have pot plants on the deck above, but they're all like... potted citrus trees and mint bushes, pretty hardy culinary species.

Did any other American grow up with the same experience as me below?

Could use some perspective on spotting someone being mistreated,"Apologies in advance for the length of what I’m recounting here - I pulled the details out of my journal app as I wanted to gather some opinion/advice on how you would deal with spotting someone who’s a victim in an abusive situation. 

I encountered this situation this afternoon and was left feeling confused on how to act. For context, I’m male and am backpacking outside of my own country. 

I was at an intersection in Auckland. I stood at the edge of the road, waiting for the crossing to turn green, as this lady passes me. She’s angrily shouting back at a guy who’s further down the street, following her. She’s very obviously furious at him for something, and is hurling things out at him as they’re passing this very public intersection.

He strides after her, returning just as much anger as she’s giving. I get the impression that they’re in a relationship. He catches her up and they’re now pretty close to one another. I watch her anger quickly turn to fear, and she starts to cry and reach to call someone on her phone. 

I’m trying to judge whether he looks like he is going to turn their argument physical, and I’m getting a bit nervous that I’m not safe either. My crossing turns Green and starts beeping whilst I’m stood there watching him continue to close in on her, and she starts to cower and continues calling someone. 

I don’t even know who you would think to call in that moment, and I don’t have to know because of the privileged position of being a guy, and that makes me feel embarrassed and isolated. It makes me feel compliant to a horrendous problem rather than an ally to its victims and feeling like I’m not doing my part to combat the harmful actions of another man. 

I keep watching, frozen with complete indecisiveness about what to do in this moment. His proximity to the girl starts to change - his face calms, he hugs her, and tries to stop her crying. 

I’m standing there processing what’s just gone on. I think about leaving and I feel like I’ve narrowly missed a scenario where I’d have had to choose whether to intervene. As I turn to leave, I finally make eye contact with the girl. We looked at each other for a moment and she’s still crying, but her face quickly turns from distraught to furious. 

She breaks free from the guy and strides towards me as she screams “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT”. My concern for her immediately switches to fear, and I sprinted across the crossing and kept running back towards my hostel.  I’m feeling scared and anxious that a car is about to scream down the road after me. 

I got back to the hostel and couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d just done, and what would have happened if he had turned to violence instead of ‘just’ emotionally manipulating her. I still felt horrendous for the lady being in that situation, but simultaneously really confused as to why someone in that situation would react in that way. I was trying to be someone who acts as an ally, rather than continuing on and being ignorant to this risk that another man would act physically against their partner. 

I don’t want to offend or exclude anyone with this - I know that physical and emotional harm can go both ways. Could just use some advice on how to deal with that kind of situation better in the future.",0,1705828665.0,t3_19bzjkk

My doorbell went off at 10:20 at night,"So I'm watching Mr. Nightmare on YouTube on my TV and it's late and I heard my doorbell ring. Anyone ever get done watching or hearing some scary video or movie and then you get paranoid afterwards? I'm mean heck I texted my mother are you up and did you hear that? She texted my younger sister and asked if she was trying to come in. Now we don't go through our front door we go through our garage door to get in our house for reasons, so I don't see why she would bother using the front door to get in. As it turns out she was in the driveway in her car at this hour and she got back to us that she saw some kids trying to ding dong ditch us.

Advice on what to do with myself.,"At the top of the year I(30f) quit a pretty not great job, because I decided I'd rather be broke than get treated like garbage. 
I have another job but it's very part time. So I am technically still working. 
But this is the first time in almost 10 years I have so much time to do anything I want, and that's where I am stuck. 
I don't know who I am, I don't know what to do with my extra time, I usually just spent it working more or doing chores or cleaning. 
I need advice on what should I do?

Do you think most people feel lazy and lethargic to go to work in the morning?,"Do you think most people feel lazy and lethargic to go to work in the morning in general?  
  
I am a guy in my mid-thirties.  
  
I tend to feel tired and lethargic when waking up every morning before going to work.  
  
I would groan if it turns out to be a workday. I would consider whether to call in sick for the day so that I can continue to sleep in my bed.  
  
I would coax myself saying that my off day will just be in a few day's time and force myself out of the bed.  
  
It's not that I don't like my job. I enjoy what I am doing in my job. It's just that I just feel tired and lazy to get out of the bed in the morning during workdays.  
  
I tend to sleep till late morning on off days though.

I am so grateful I was never a target of bullying growing up.,"We watched a movie last night (Sing Street) and a major part of the plot was how the main character and his friends were bullied.  This led my girlfriend to start bringing up stories about how her and her brother were bullied growing up. It was awful.  And I have heard so many other horror stories from other people.

I am so glad I was never a target as a kid.  I was pretty big, I was well on my way to 6' by middle school and I was 6'2"" by the end of high school... even with my knee surgery that was designed to keep one of my legs from growing for 3 years.  When I say big, I wasn't big in the sense that anyone would have called ""fat"" but I was definitely not scrawny.

I was also extremely shy. I rarely spoke to anyone at school outside a few close friends and my siblings.  My main ""thing"" in school was art, mostly drawing strange cartoons. Drawing was pretty much all I did at school during class, during lunch, whenever.  This seemed to be universally acceptable to my peers because all I ever got about it was compliments. Never once did someone say something mean about my drawing.

Too big to push around. Too quiet to get on anyone's nerves or to probably even be noticed by most people at all. That's probably what saved me.

What was or is your experience with bullying? Did or does it happen to you a lot? Did or do you see it a lot? Do you think it had any bearing on who you became as an adult?

Yesterday was a great day,"I meant to post this yesterday but I was too busy. Not only was I busy at work yesterday 🤑. But almost all of my clients were sports massage clients.   

I'm trying to build a career where I only or mainly work on non professional athletes and dancers.  I love how it feels to help everyday people improve their performance in the gym or whatever athletic endeavor they engage in.  I also love working on musicians because it provides me the same feeling. 

When I work on these people it feels like I'm helping them to become the people they want to be and not just helping them suffer another day in the future like it feels when I work on office workers.  They also complain less than other massage clients and don't trauma dump on me.  So I don't have to hear about how much they hate their spouse, kids, boss and parents all day.  

Yesterday was just amazing.  All of my clients felt better getting off the table and could do the movements they couldn't before.  This is why I do what I do.  Two years ago I told myself if I couldn't make it at sports massage and had to do relaxation and neck massage all day I'd leave the industry.   

I'm not where I want to be but I'm not stressing financially.  I love working on the vast majority of my clients.  It feels like m in a dream.  I'm getting paid a living wage to help other people be their best selves and they thank me at the end 🥰😁😊",0,1705790576.0,t3_19bo34w
I just got hit hard with the realization that I need a job urgently.,"I've always been quite the lazy fucker, but with a high IQ so I somehow managed to go through studies n shit.

Recently, I completed my last internship, then I had to do a trip abroad, and that trip was the last thing to do to get my degree. Until then my parents had been paying for pretty much everything, and I was often spending a bit more than they gave me but it was fine, I had savings.

But for the last few months I've been spending and spending on usual life stuff, without any salary (had one during my internship though).

Now I've just realized that my accounts will be empty within about a month, I only have 2 weeks of medicine left (for some genetic disease I have), and going to the doctor for a new prescription will cost because I'm 25 so I can't benefit from my parents' healthcare anymore. Also it seems my computer is getting old and the hard drive is starting to have problems. 

So yeah I need money fast, and I'm gonna need a job close to where I live because I don't have a car and there's just a single bus line near where I am, but there are like 3 companies around and that's it.

Oh and of course these companies refuse to hire me until I have my degree, so I contacted my school and they said they might be able to provide a document that confirms I validated my degree, but not until two to three weeks.

Ngl that's kinda stressful. Not so long ago I was planning stuff for the future, now I'll be happy if I still have a roof in 2 months.",0,1705789096.0,t3_19bnjlw

Can you even avoid sleeping through an alarm?,"I have a pretty good track record of getting up when my alarm goes off. Today, though, I had an all-day even where I needed to get up around 5. It's just a thing with some friends. I know for a fact that I had an alarm set for 5:10 AM (it's still on right now). I woke up around 8 AM today and I saw nothing on my phone that indicated it had gone off. That means it either didn't go off, or I somehow turnt it off and was so tired that my brain didn't record any memory of it.

Either way, it's really annoying. I made up a lie that I woke up with a fever this morning and that Instagram didn't send my message when I tried to tell them before going back to sleep. In reality, I don't know what happened. Maybe my phone went through an unexpected software update? Maybe I genuinely did just turn it off and have literally no recall? It bothers me a lot. Seeing all of those messages and the 2 calls I got of ""hey wya? we're waiting"" really sucks. I feel pretty fuckin stupid.

A life lesson,"There are so many people on this planet with so many different stories. Everyone has someone unique to say. We all underestimate the absurdity and the chaotic nature of life, some people understand it early while some take a lifetime, well it doesn't really matter. Life is very RANDOM. Anything can happen to you anytime, anywhere. These things makes life very fragile. A chaotic , non deterministic system. So what should we do ? How we should face it ? By planning ? No, a hard coded plan is not really the way. You are trying to plan chaos. The clash between your plans and life'd chaos will only lead you to suffering. A plan should only be made for the things that can be calculated, that are deterministic,  that can be boiled down to numbers.
A non deterministic system should be faced in a non deterministic way , or as many people say it by ""Embracing the chaos"".

To move out or to not move out…,"
I’m a 27 year old single female debating on whether I should move out of my mom’s house. I have a career making about $88,000 which can increase quite a bit when I work my per diem job. I live in a low cost of living city. I do date but nothing serious and I honestly am not interested in living with anyone else anytime soon. 

The issue is, my mom is not supportive of me moving out. She likes having her kids home and doesn’t feel like I am ready. I have 5 siblings ranging from ages 37-14. Only one has moved out and another is about to ONLY because he is expecting his first child. She’s not happy about him moving. I have a great relationship with my mom & siblings and I have a good home environment. My mom claims she likes knowing that we are safe and wants us to save so we don’t struggle in the future. Part of me feels like she is kind of harming us more than helping us in a way. 

I have completed a housing program that offers no down payment required, no closing costs, below average interest rates and no PMI.

That happened a few weekend mornings after that. My brother, who would’ve been in likely first grade at the time (about 7 years old) comes home from school the next day with a huge biography of George Washington that he had taken out of the library thinking that would appease my father.

Should I learn to drive?,"I dedicated two decades of my life to the path of Jain monkhood, embracing this way of life at the age of 14.

For those who try to maintain a shoeless home who seems to rebel or push back the most?,"
Or covert to a shoeless home for that matter . Especially in terms of family members in the household. 

In my experience over the years that those who are very physically active sporty types tend to skip out on removing sneakers or violating the no shoe zone the most by running in and out with sneakers still on. Other people or youngsters who are less athletic regularly seem to be more respectful of the shoe free zones. I be curious why, is it due to mentality changes that can result from participating in sports which may cause a more laid back or rebellious mind set?

I also do notice those who played a game of whatever ball or had been shooting hoops in backyard seem more likely to stay in sneakers inside in those situation than at other times which they would take them off as normal. 

Fortunately I notice it’s not nearly as bad these days compared to 10-20 years ago.",0,1705734302.0,t3_19b5xyl
It is truly amazing how people who have so little give so much.,"We were driving back from a friend’s house when we spotted a homeless guy. We talked to him and asked if he wanted us to call 311 to pick him as temperatures are dropping below freezing tonight. He said he can’t because he’d lose his possessions. We offered to pick up blankets and other warming items and he accepted. When we drove back with the items we spotted the man giving and tucking a younger homeless guy with his only blanket (we had not given him the ones we got for him). I have been thinking the entire night about how he had so little and on a frigid night and he was still willing to share that with another human being.

I used to have such a cool life,"And I mean I still do.  My life is cool.  I live in my hometown in North America in a house with my mom and my aunt.  I’m almost 30, and according to society, I should be off on my own and independent.  But actually, for once in my life, I’m past caring what that expectation is.  I can help my mom with technology and shoveling, I can suggest my aunt recipes and eat what she makes.  I have a fully remote job I actually like with lots of learning and growth.  I’ve been Nordic skiing three times this week in the park near my house with my mom.  I’m skiing with my friends this weekend.  

And sometimes?  Sometimes I think of what my life was like 2 January’s ago.  The little Middle Eastern grocery store I would stop at after my group squash lessons in Belgium on Sunday mornings.  Because grocery stores are mostly closed in Belgium on Sundays (except for a chain called carrefour) but that store was always open.  How I’d stuff my backpack full of incredible bread and bagels and eggs and Turkish delight, and bike home and eat lunch and do my laundry and get some work done.  

I had this dream to live abroad and I lived it.  And sometimes being back home feels a little shocking, because it was never the plan to come back.  And I wonder sometimes - career success, adventure, being there for your family when shit hits the fan, a routine that you created from scratch with the absence of the world you grew up in, novelty and people who matter - how are we supposed to balance all the ups and downs and all the challenges of balancing things we can’t always balance?  I don’t know, I really don’t.  But sometimes I just want to step back into that life for a split second, lock up my bike, fill my backpack with Turkish delight and ingredients I can’t even quite remember, and sit in my tiny 300 square foot apartment again.  Because it was mine and that was my life I built, and there’s something incredible about that.  But for now, I’m going to enjoy the life I have here and now.",0,1705727488.0,t3_19b42yb

One of the items they had was a cute moto jacket in beautiful, very realistic grey fake mink fur (sort of like what Veruca Salt wears in the 2006 *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* adaptation). It was $250, roughly half a week's wages for me. I waited months for it to go on sale, but when it finally did, they were sold out of my size. I searched the Web high and low for my size in this coat, knowing there are department stores and boutiques that carry the brand. I finally found one in stock at a lone, obscure boutique in New England that has an online store. It was $250, so not sale price. I hemmed and hawed for weeks over whether or not to buy it - as a general rule I **never** pay full price for clothing.

What is a nickname that people call you? How did you get it?,"Hello, Reddit! I’ve been called Evie for the longest, since before Pre-K, I believe. I met one of my best friends, Kayla, at this Head Start Program when we were both 4 years old. On the day we met in particular, it was nap time at the program, and our sleeping mats were next to each other.

“What’s your name?” She whispered.

“My name is Yvette!”

“Evie?”

“No, *Yvette*,” I corrected. She proceeded to tell me that her name was Kayla - we clicked and became best friends immediately, and still are to this day almost 18 years later.

Because she couldn’t pronounce her T’s correctly, Kayla just called me Evie and I rolled with it. Since then, majority of my close friends and buddies call me Evie instead of Yvette. Even though we’re full-grown adults now, every single time we see each other or talk on the phone, the conversation between me and Kayla always starts out as: “Hi, Evie!” and “Hey, Kaylabug!”

Getting a job was a huge source of stress for the past year or so. Arguing with my relatives, getting rejection mails on a Monday morning, on a Friday afternoon, not getting mails after interviews etc.. you know it.

I'm not sure if I like the position in itself as I took it because there wasn't anything else at that time (surprisingly enough I've got interviews and mails right after).

I'm not sure if I'll be up to the challenge, if I'll make it past the probation period, if I'll like my new life, if I will make good friends and connections there, etc...

I am the youngest child in my family and this is what i want to say towards all older brother and sister. You are my first role model in life not our parents. I will always remember how you give up the thing you want because our parents treated me better but as i grew up i do feel bad about it. I also remember everything that you gave/buy even as small as the choclairs. I know all my wrongdoings toward you as i grew up and i do regret it but hey i am never going to go and apologize to your face.

I feel bad because I translated a insult that I wasn’t supposed to,"So I was translating for my friend at work but he constantly was switching between saying stuff just to me and then saying stuff for me to translate to the other person.

Anyways he insulted her and it was funny and I translated it without thinking that it was just for me. She didn’t find it funny and apparently I wasn’t supposed to translate it.

In the culture of the language we all insult each other and it’s very blunt but it’s not in a mean spirited way it’s in a joking way. It wasn’t even that bad of an insult honestly like it had nothing to with her appearance or personality.

Honestly how I see it is that it’s more rude to talk about someone when they’re right there but can’t understand you. Because I’ve been on that side of things so I know that the person can clearly tell when they’re being talked about and are assuming the worst and feeling left out. If we’re having a conversation with two people who know different languages then one person who knows them both then that shouldn’t be happening.

Anyways she knows a second language also that I don’t know but majority of the other employees know so I’m pretty sure she talks about me when I’m right there all the time since then.

Positivity is for everyone (change my mind),"You come here at lonely times. At depressing times. Even at happy times. Hence here is something. For you
  
You are strong. You are beautiful. You are dazzling. You are handsome. You are brave. You are bold. You are courageous. You are disciplined. You are intelligent. You are smart. You are unique. You are different. You are fun. You are funny. You are responsible. You are passionate. You are charismatic. You are talented. Multi-skilled. You are deserving. You are acclaimed. You are mannerly. You are kind. You are calm. You are polite. Most importantly, you are humane. You. Are. Awesome.  
  
Why all of a sudden? Why do I have to just add an adjective at the end of “You are”? Simple. People deserve appreciation. Any difficulty in the current era is constantly being problematized and asserted. Collations and contrasts have become a bane to a person’s measure of success. A burden adding to a person’s difficulties. A constant illness to her capabilities making her question herself. Is she doing it the right way? Does she look good while doing it? Is she sufficient? Has she accomplished enough? Is she qualified? Is she skilled? Is she emotionally strong? Is she talented? Is she willing? Is she sure? Is she… Is she… Is she…  
  
I am not talking about meager acceptance. That’s just cowardliness where you sit back and overthink your inability and thus end up stagnating at the same place. No. But the ladder to success is not merely filled with physical constraints these days but more of psychological and mental restrictions that the person is being inflicted upon at all times by the society and by herself. Always a constant pullback that makes a person speculate herself over and over due to peer pressure, societal rules, community guidelines, social acceptance with persistent comments from people they encounter everyday either in real life or through social media. Questioning. Criticizing. Conjecturing. Comparing every action. Every movement. Every moment. With judgmental opinions. With biased decisions. With disrespect. With cruelty.  
  
It is not easy. Not for anyone. Not for me. Not for you. There is no measurement. Maybe the times I am going through are “rougher” than yours. It doesn’t necessarily mean your situation is easy. But the fact that you are able to outperform and sustain in this competitive world with so much energy and courage is exactly what needs to be enlightened. That you are also an “able” person with equal willpower. The road is not going to be smooth. It is not going to be easy. You might face difficulties that no one has ever faced. Disrespectful comments. That you are not worthy. You might even be used. Might be disregarded. This world is a vicious place. And for that I can only say this. You deserve all the happiness in the world. All the respect in the world. All the positivity in the world. Just for being able to do what you are doing. Just for enduring this callousness. Just for being who you are. And for that, I write this to you. A tribute. An accolade. For being a part of this world. For being able to survive. For your energy. For your existence. For your presence. For you. For all of what is you. I whole heartedly thank you for being yourself. You. Are. Awesome.",0,1705675709.0,t3_19akr8s
Had a wonderful morning!,"So I woke up a little later than usual today but still did my daily Yoga and meditation, used the bathroom, took a shower, wore nice clothes it’s pretty cold where I live so wore some thermals, cleaned up my room a bit, had something to eat for breakfast and left to catch a bus for work.

And I've been noticing that doing these menial small things in the morning make me feel so good that when I get of the bus I'm sometimes literally frolicking in joy the last mile walk to my work. It occured to me how people can just transform their lives for the better by a huge margin with just these few changes to their lifestyle. This is something I started doing by observing my parents and many other people in my family. And after I implemented this into my Life, it actually started making a phenomenal difference.

Maybe what lies ahead in the day is not completely in my control, but it kinda feels like I'm coming in fully prepared mentally and physically into the day and giving my best, and that definitely feels like a great start! Hell, that's actually a wonderful start. Worst case, I at least feel alive to Life rather than drowsy and moody. It does really feel like it's those simple changes that I feel the need to start with to make things better for myself. I think that these extra efforts in the morning can be the decider between a beautiful and long day. Don't you guys think so too?

Someone has my AirPods,"
I gave my teenage daughter my AirPods back in August. She frequently loses things. I know this about her and we're working on it. Anyway, she apparently lost these AirPods as my Find My feature popped up the other day to tell
me they were in a location about 20 miles away. Naturally, my daughter has no idea how they got there. The location is a house and they've consistently been in and out of that house, running errands locally, at a gas station, etc.  I tried activating the beeping but they're too far away. I activated the lost feature but they must have already been connected because they're still using them. 

 I tracked down the homeowner and messaged her on FB to let her know and she basically said they buy their own stuff and don't have my AirPods. I sent her a few screenshots shots showing them at her house and at a local gas station so she'd know they were with an individual and not just in her yard. Her last response was ""what's your point?"" .

I'm really tempted to start F-ing with them. Send screen shots of where they are, drive down there and start activating the beeping over and over and over etc., mostly due to her response.  

Should I do this or just let it go? I know I'll never get the AirPods back and honestly, who wants them after they've been in someone else's ears, but a simple ""my son found them and has been using them, we didn't know how to identify the original owner"" would have ended it. I was more curious how she got them than how to get them back.",0,1705668169.0,t3_19ai8kv

Does anyone have any unexpectedly pleasant hotel experiences they would want to share?,"I was doing some traveling for work that unexpectedly took me north, so I booked a room at a rather highly rated hotel that was located in a small 'town' of possibly less than 1500 people. As someone who travels quite a bit; I think it was possibly the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, in terms of the mix of amenities and atmosphere. About 1/3rd of the building was used to house a museum dedicated to local history, which in this case meant the history of the American railyards, the rooms were clean enough to qualify for being used as a surgical theater, the furnishings were high quality, and I actually got a good night's sleep in a hotel. I'm kind of baffled by the whole situation as it's not as if I can earnestly suggest for people to seek the place out, but I have spent thrice as much as spent there a night and gotten half the genuine pleasure from being there.",0,1705658298.0,t3_19afo51
Unsure Undergrad,"Apologies for the long post! I know this may be a little out of place but…
Context: Hello! I’m currently getting my BA in Psychology and I am a first generation college student (so most of the help I have received in terms of what in the world I am doing with myself has come from google, the occasional conversation with professors, and reddit). I am supposed to be graduating this time next year and have been building up a “nice” transcript/GPA in hopes of continuing on to get my masters.
Here’s where I need help/advice. I want to be a child psychologist with education/experience if not certification in the world of play therapy. I took part in a practicum recently that unveiled my love for working with children and a desire to dedicate myself to learning play therapy practices in specific. I have some interest in adolescents as well but I have almost completely leaned away from working exclusively with adults since my freshman year. I decided on a masters because while I want to publish things in the future (maybe a book or two who knows nothing too fancy)… I do not think a PhD or the “title of being a doctor” is necessary for me to do so. Which is the impression I was under before… to be respected I “must” pursue the highest education possible.
Anyways, would the best route be to pursue a masters program focused on mental health counseling but specify my concentration in child development/child psychology? Is clinical psychology a better approach for this? Are there any universities in particular with programs that would best fit my situation? Any bits of knowledge or concepts I do not seem to fully understand?
I have a list of some schools I am interested in that have been accredited by the APA and some if not most also being accredited by the play therapy association. Yes, I have looked into them and the many professors behind the various programs… but everything feels so much more overwhelming than it probably is. I am starting to freak myself out, convince myself that I do not know what I am doing, and overall I have been stuck in a loop for a few months of googling the same questions over and over only to find the same answers that send me back into the loop again. I know that social work and marriage counseling are things I would like to stay away from if at all possible.

Hobby Hopping,"Hi, 23F here! I'm just curious as to see if others have the same hobby Hopping issue I do. Whats your current obsession right now? 

I've been a very artistic person all my life but I've always been very indecisive as well.
Right now I'm absolutely ENTHRALLED with Crochet and yarn art. I've taught myself how to crochet (something my therapist recommended I try that, before I swore on my life I'd never do) and now that's all I want to do. I've gotten pretty consistent with it now :]

But this is how it goes with all my hobbies. 

About three months ago I was VERY into 3d printing little small figurines. 
Six months ago I was making bracelets with pony beads and weird phrases on them.
A year ago I was back into my painting phase. I'll go back and forth between all the hobbies I have as well. Who knows, in the next two months I might go back to 3d printing? Or paper crafting that I haven't done in years, or even video games, or singing. I can't tell anymore 

Occasionally my interests do the same things too. For some time I'm very obsessed with one particular thing and then once I'm with that for a while, ANOTHER new particular thing will take that place for another while. 

I'm not sure if this has something to do with my -now- diagnosed ADHD. (I have almost no doubt it probably does) but I have a kind of dread piling up on me of all the unfinished projects I have tucked away.

"Ive known that I can be immediately off-putting to some people, and the older I get the less I care about that fact.","Ive always kind of known, since I was a 15-16 year old teenager, that I am apparently abrasive to some people.  I dont quite know what it is, because it's not often you have an opportunity to ask people why they dont like you.  Im assuming it's actually not how I am saying something, but actually what I am saying in most instances.  
  
  Im pretty quick witted and I love poking fun at things, and I think that I raise people's guard quickly, because I dont really act any differently towards strangers as I do with my friends.  I dont have a guard until people give me a reason for me to have one, so I basically treat people the same.  I realize isnt necessarily the best approach, but I dont really enjoy anyone's company that takes life too seriously.  So I feel like my personality tends to weed out people, that to me, are too uptight and rigid.  
  
  Abrasive is probably a the best word to describe me upon first meeting me, despite the fact that I dont have any ill-intent, ever.  If I have ill-intent in my words, that person, and anyone who hears it, would definitely know I were serious.  However, at any job or hobby (involving others) that ive ever had, after a certain amount of time, I seem to befriend every single person, regardless of gender, nationality, etc. etc..  I work in a restaurant with people from 16 to 56.  Most are in their 30s, but I get along with everyone.  The older folks, the younger folks, man or woman, doesnt matter they all will seek me out to just chat.  
  
  It's really great when you *gel* with everyone, but it can take me a while to win some people over.  Ive been there a year, and up until just a few months ago, one of your servers was a little standoffish towards me, but nowadays she busts my balls right back and we joke around like brother sister.  When you first meet me you may not like me, but I grow on you, because I think people realize I have good heart and intent (I hope), and that im someone you can confide in and seek advice from.  I think it's pretty clear by this post that im definitely opinionated, but im extremely flexible.  Ill occasionally make wild statements like 'X always happens when Y goes down', and im only partially serious and im usually being quite hyperbolic.  
  
  So I was kind of curious what everyone here thinks that *other people* think of them?  I love some good ol' fashioned introspection.  I also think it's important to be polite and kind when youre around others, despite what you might be going through, so I try to be fairly jovial and upbeat, pretty much all the time.  Granted, when you cant hold in anymore, everyone around you knows something is going on, which then prompts everyone to ask *'Are you ok?'*, since everyone is legitimately concerned.  How do you find yourself blending with your co-workers?  Your family, friends?  Is there anything about yourself that youre actively working on changing?

How to make the YTM notification black?,"When it comes up with the song that's playing how do I make the notification black instead of white?

10 years later and I'm still thinking about her.,"Back when I was in college, I met the most amazing, beautiful girl. 

We hit it off super quickly. We weren't even on the same course as each other. I did engineering, she did art, we met on the bus.
We'd meet up for drinks and to hang out after college, I couldn't get enough of her.

Looking back, we were extremely flirtatious with each other, I just didn't see it at the time. 
I really liked her, but I was in a serious relationship with my first proper girlfriend at the time. She was also in a serious relationship but broke things off with him pretty early into our friendship. This might have been a sign for me to do the same, I just didn't see it at the time.

I wasn't happy in my relationship, but I found it hard to break things off after being together for so many years. There was this one time when my (now ex) girlfriend was away for the weekend. Me and my friend got quite drunk at a party, stripped down to our underwear, and started fooling around in bed. I still remember the warm feel of her skin. I knew it was wrong. We both did. We didn't sleep with each other, although we might as well have, as I'd still consider what we did as cheating.

We never spoke about what happened. I remember asking her if she wanted to talk about it, but she didn't. 

There was another time, a year or two later, where we were out drinking with friends. I had finally broken up with my ex at this point, and it was the first time we'd gone out properly since. 
The two of us decided to split off from the group to go into a different bar for a few drinks. I was extremely drunk, but I can remember us making out like there was no tomorrow. 
I remember waking up the next day vaguely remembering what happened. As I sobered up and my memories were coming back, I started to remember the night more clearly. I messaged her something along the lines of ""omg did we kiss last night??"". She didn't want to talk about it. She was drunk and wasn't in control.
I remember messaging my best friend later on that day to tell him what had happened. I was still excited that something had finally happened, even if she didn't want to talk about it.
My friend told me that she had kissed another one of the boys that night, too. I felt gutted. But we were both single, she has every right to kiss whoever she wants to.

Things slowly went back to normal. If she didn't want to talk to me about these things, I wasn't going to pursue.

A few months later, she sent me a Snapchat while she was on a night out. She sent a video of her saying something. All I can remember is that she was crying.
I was over a friend's house at the time, and for some reason, I decided to watch the video with my phone muted. 
I messaged her, apologising that I couldn't hear her. I asked her if she was OK and if she wanted to talk. The next day, she got back to me, and she didn't want to talk about it.

After a few years of college, she went to university and met a new friend group, got a new boyfriend, etc. They didn't last long.


As the years went by, we slowly grew apart, until eventually we stopped contact completely. 

I'm in a new relationship now. 7 years down the line, and I'm feeling the same way as I did before, unsatisfied. For years, I'd think of my old friend every single day, missing them and wondering what they're up to. I struggle in this relationship and with previous ones, constantly comparing girls with her. I know I shouldn't, and I feel deeply guilty about it.

I've recently stopped smoking weed after several years of addiction. 
Although I don't think about her as much anymore, I've recently started having dreams again. I've had a few dreams about her now. Last night was the most vivid one so far. I dreamt that we had met up with each other, along with a few other college friends. We ended up having a deep conversation about what's happened to us over the years and why I haven't reached out to her. This resulted in me finally leaving my current girlfriend and giving things a shot with her instead. 

There's been a few times when I've wanted to message her to ask if she wants to meet up. I feel like I've matured a lot over the years (I'm now 29), so maybe she'd be happy to talk things through with me now? 
She hasn't been on social media for a few years now. Every time I've looked for her, she's never there. 
I haven't heard anything about her in years, from anyone. I bet she's travelling the world, doing amazing things. 
I know things would never work out between us, I doubt I'll even see her ever again. I just wish I could have the chance to talk to her one last time. I have so many unanswered questions.

Man, I miss her.",0,1705596094.0,t3_199udpq

Did anyone else do this when they were kids?,"There were three games that my siblings and I absolutly loved to play, and apparently a friend played the same games when she was a kid.

1) rolling down the stairs- using a sleeping bag or blanket and all the pillows you can find, wrap yourself up and have a sibling push you down the stairs. It was less a roll and more a bumby slide, but we called it rolling. 

2) worms- wrap yourself in a sleeping bag or blankets so you cannot move your arms or legs, and try to move across the room. This entertained us for hours.

3) Sandwich- place one couch cushion on the floor, then a child, then the second cushion, leaving the child's head out. Everyone else jumps on top of the pile for a minute, then someone else gets to be the sandwich. This was our favorite, you could get out anger at a sibling and not get in trouble, because it was actually fun to be the sandwich too. 

It makes me laugh to remember how we entertained ourselves as kids, the dumbest things seemed so fun. As we've grown apart, I've started remembering all our games and jokes again, and it makes me want to reconnect with them. Do you have funny games you played growing up?",0,1705593781.0,t3_199th50

Anybody else get Deja vu right before you fall asleep?,"This might not make any sense but I’ll try to explain it the best I can.

There’s been so many nights this happens to me.  When I’m in that zone between wake and sleep, as you can kind of feel yourself drifting off, I’ll get Deja vu.  At least I think that’s what it is.

I’ll have a whole storyline in my head of something that happened that day or something I need to do.  The other night I was thinking about how I needed to go to the bank the next day because I had to order new checks so I could send a voided check to the mortgage company for the house I was about to close on.  And then i realized that none of that was true - I didn’t need to go the bank at all and I wasn’t buying a house.  But it’s almost as though my brain came up with this whole thing in about 2 seconds and it felt completely real, like I had actually lived through the whole thing, including remembering the whole process of buying the house and meeting with the loan officer and all that.  Then when i realized it wasn’t real it was like i shifted realities, like the simulation was changed.

"I have to choose between two ""serious money"" hobbies","Hi! My hobbies include reading, gaming and crosswords (and I am trying to learn how to knit) but I also take aerial silks classes 2 times a week and western riding class once a week with occasional trail rides on Sundays. 

These last two are, at least were I live and for my current situation, becoming too expensive for me.

The silks classes are in the evening, I work a 9-5 and have a 40min drive to and from work every day. Although my ""classmates"" are wonderful, the teacher is awesome and I never had a ""sport"" group like that growing up, I always feel exhausted and progress far slower than my mates (sometimes I even got home crying because I feel so weak). Now they are preparing for a competition, and this means one more class on Saturdays. If I don't sign up for the competition, I know that the teacher would be more focused on the people training for that, so I feel I would be paying for basically being on my own...

I could become stronger and try to catch up with the others by going to the gym but I don't really have the energy and time during the week...

If I decide to try for the competition, I fear that would be a major trigger for my anxiety + pausing my riding classes, which lately have been much more beneficial to my mental health than aerials...

I feel like this is the point where I have to choose one of those things, considering that I cannot economically do both.

I know that ultimately I have to find the answer within me, but I am just curious to know what other people might do in my place, or if somebody at their point in life faced a similar decision :)",0,1705575318.0,t3_199nix2

Update - asking dad to move in with us,"I was on here a little while ago chatting about how my husband and I were going to ask my dad to move in with us.  Here's the update I promised people:

&#x200B;

dad came over to watch the college football title game with us.  (He, myself, and my husband are all Washington graduates, so please no comment on the game) and we popped the question after the game.

&#x200B;

I'll spare you all the emotional moments of that, but he said yes, he would.  His move-in date is tentatively scheduled for the weekend after Memorial Day.  That gives him time to pack, sell the house, and anything else he needs to do before then.  A couple of my husband's friends are going to help us in cleaning the house, doing touch up yard work, and moving him over here.  So, it all turned out well.  I think it will be emotional for him to leave that house, but we'll deal with that when we get to it.

&#x200B;

Funny note - we called my brother afterwards to tell him that it was all taken care of.  I talked to my niece who usually stayed in my bedroom when my brother and family came to visit.  She stayed in my old room, which looked the same as it did when I graduated high school.  She's 10 now, but asked what's going to happen to a poster I had up in the room.  It was a bare-chested model in the surf with the headline, ""A hard man is good to find"".  So she sheepishly asked me what was going to happen to it.  She didn't want any details about dad's move, just wanted to know what was going to happen with my poster.  she said it made her feel safe, and I commented that it made me feel something too, which is why I had it up.  She responded as if I had just said something really gross and said quietly, ""OOh.  You're talking about sex, right?""  guess at 10, she still thinks it and boys are gross, though that didn't stop her from inquiring about the poster.

I did stand-up at an open mic for the first time with no preparation,"I'm on a big ""force myself to do things I otherwise wouldn't"" kick, and part of it hinges on this philosophy I developed where if something isn't going to harm me, but I feel apprehensive about it, I just say fuck it and take the plunge. This started out small in walking up to strangers and making conversation, to eventually scaling up to what happened last weekend. 

The long and short of it was that my friend runs a bar, and they do open mic every once in a while. I made an offhand comment that it would be funny to do stand up and totally bomb. Just go up and absolutely humiliate myself. Flash forward to later that night and suddenly there's a light on me and everyone's watching.

To say it went well would be lying. But it actually was nowhere near as bad as I was anticipating and that was a total win for me (LOL): it started out with that deafening silence and -- the horror -- a couple pity laughs, but as I got into the groove (I basically forced myself into the headspace that I was just talking to a friend about a funny memory) I started seeing some faces light up and heard some actual laughter -- and that was like an electric feeling that I can't really put into words. Like a straight injection of liquid adrenaline.

So did I bomb? Yep. But I'm pretty sure I got at least a couple real reactions and that's already way more than I could have asked for. Also it helped that the guy that went after me was somehow way worse. No offense to him LMAO",0,1705554143.0,t3_199i54p

"Yeah, No Problem.","I start my day every morning at 7am. I hear my kids singing along with the alarm clock or playing in their rooms already. I throw something on to go pick them up out of bed and begin our morning. I let the dog out and grab a water.  

“daddy can we watch a cartoon?”

Yeah, no problem. What do you wanna watch?

One of them picks a show while the other loses their mind. I scoop them up into my arms and give them sleepy morning cuddles and explain tomorrow is their turn and we take turns. We settle in and I pull the blanket over us as we wake up together and wipe the sleep out of my eyes. 

“Daddy can we have breakfast?”

Yeah, no problem. What do you wanna eat?

They select their respective morning food, typically cereal or oatmeal.. sometimes pancakes if I have a little extra time. I give them their breakfast, let our dog back in, and feed him as well. Give him some morning scruffs and loving pats. I check my phone to see what time it is. I hear her foot steps from around the corner. 

“Hey can you make me a coffee?”

Yeah, no problem. 

I turn on the coffee maker and get her mug around and start up the coffee. I head over to the bathroom and turn on the shower. Waters cold again. It does that in the winter, something about a filter getting debris caught. 

“Is the water cold?”

Yeah, no problem. I’ll be right back. 

Fix her coffee just the way she likes and I leave it on the counter. Walk by the kids and give them little head pats. Tell them I’ll be right back, the water is cold again. Go to the basement and tap on the filter until I hear the water turn over. I get ready for work and head out of the day. I’m only there for a few minutes. 

“Hey, can you to handle this account? Someone called off today.”

Yeah, no problem

It doesn’t matter I feel like I’m drowning sometimes with the amount of things stacked on my desk. Same four walls I’ll probably die in. It gives me what I need to barely scrape by but it’s enough. I make sure the kids have what they need, I make sure she has her hobbies. I’ll do what I can if it’s possible. 

“Hey I’m heading out early. Do you mind covering for me?”

Yeah, no problem. 

I’ll never let them know what I’m feeling. I’ll keep my nose to the grind stone and provide what life I can. They deserve it… I deserve it… right? Every night when I get home the kids hold the door closed and I have to summon all my strength to open it but man, a 5 year old and 3 year old… they are formidable. 

“I’m not feeling good. Do you mind if I go lay down?”

Yeah, no problem. 

I won’t tell her about my day and how hectic it was. I won’t tell her I’m feeling overwhelmed and socialized out. I won’t tell her I’m on the verge of a melt down. Little eyes and ears always watching and listening for their superhero to come be… super. 

“Daddy can we watch what you’re doing?”

Yeah, no problem. 

They sit with me and chat to each other and ask me what I’m doing 1000 times and I answer each time, even if it’s what I just said 10 seconds ago. They deserve a dad who wants them around as much as they want him to be around. They don’t deserve the childhood I had. I give them their dinners and take a helping to her. Kids and I eat together and I ask about their day. 

“Daddy, can we play a game?”

Yeah, no problem. 

We decide what we want to play and it’s always their favorite turtle game. I crawl around with a blanket over me and they pretend to be dinosaurs and eat me alive. We wrestle and romp until they need to start getting ready for bed. 

“Hey after we put the kids to bed, don’t forget to clean up the kitchen.”

Yeah, no problem. 

Except, it’s pretty much done. I did the dishes while dinner was cooking. I even started laundry while I was eating. I picked up the living room, vacuumed, tidied everything up because I like things to be simple and clean. I sit down after finishing up what we used for dinner.

“Hey can you cut me up a veggie bowl. I’m still a little hungry.”

Yeah, no problem.

At this point, this has been the same day. Over and over for who knows how long. I know it’s coming but nothing changes. Am I stuck in a loop? Everyone sees me as a great father. An amazing husband. I barely believe I qualify as anything good. I feel like I’m just floating through. After a little bit of time to play some video games and disconnect for a minute I’m getting ready for bed. 

“Hey can you scoop the cat litter?”

Yeah, no problem.

Here I am. Sharing my today… my everyday… I’m going to be alright.

I'm not sure even where to ask this (typing errors).,"So, over the past couple of years I've noticed that I make a lot of errors when I'm typing something out. Now, I know people make typos and that happens all the time, but I'm using completely wrong words that are sometimes not even close to what I mean. Sometime I'll leave out entire words.

I've always tried to explain this away to myself as ""my brain is working faster than my type,"" as if I'm such a quick thinker. It seems worse than that. Even worse, if it weren't for grammar checkers and spellcheck baked into the browser, it would be much much worse. Reading things back to myself I often wouldn't catch these things. 

Is this just age catching up to me? I don't have trouble with the actual typing. I type easily and probably about 60-70 wpm. I don't have problem reading, so it's probably not any type of dyslexia. My memory has been really bad, like a brain fog at times, which could be related in some way. It's also not constant. I haven't seen any errors in this post, but I'm also not checking.

I've crashed a different car into a different tree while driving in the snow. (Rear wheel drive, plus young and dumb) that car was also totaled. I've also gotten stuck in the snow about 4 times and my dad had to get the tractor to pull me out of the ditch. Basically, I shouldn't drive in the snow. I finally have a car that is meant to be in the snow but I'm too terrified to drive it and risk crashing our only car. Employers don't consider snow as an excuse to call out unless it's really bad.

"Any other writers here? I'm working on a sequel to my book, and am interested in hearing about your projects too!","I enjoy writing a lot, and have a couple of books under my belt so far. My latest WIP is a sequel to my last book. I'd like to talk about it if that's ok. I promise I'm not trying to promote anything, I'm just proud of my work.

It centers around an alien species called the Zmite, with whom humanity has integrated on a new planet called named Hope, and the power struggle between the governments of the planet as the mystery of humanity's arrival over a thousand years ago begins to unravel.

In the first book, which takes place in the Kuiper Belt, a region of space beyond Neptune with a bunch of asteroids and planetoids, a group of protagonists face an unfolding horror as the secrets of life are close to being revealed and the Kuiper Administration begins to clamp down. In the end, humanity, which hasn't left but has colonized all of the Sol system, is forced to take drastic measures to ensure the encroaching danger is snuffed out.

The two survivors from that book have made it to a new planet called Hope in a one-way shot aboard a cryogenics-equipped ship in the sequel. Now, almost a thousand Earth-years later, the ship they rode in on is revered as sacred, and humanity, birthed from embryos aboard the ship, is thriving in a hybrid human-alien society with the Zmite. Something is lurking in the skies above though, and when a mysterious ship crash lands on Hope (this is the first time other aliens, besides humans, have visited the planet), the slumbering secrets of the ancient human ship begin to unfurl. 

I plan on making this a series, with epic space battles, romance, action, mysteries, and suspense. A space opera, if you will. There is a galactic federation controlled by a deep state known as the Invilave that knows of humanity's sacrifice, and a confederated government known as the Outer Allied Worlds, who does not. The tension between them plays an integral part to the story as the horrors from the first book begin to rear their ugly heads again, threatening the entire galaxy. I plan on calling this series ""The Andromeda Crisis"".

What are your WIPs, series', or favorite stories you've written? I love talking writing with people and would love to hear yours. Or, alternatively, if you have questions about the Andromeda Crisis, please ask! It'll help me world build!",0,1705520308.0,t3_1995j0d

Ever since I moved closer to work, the chances of me and my coworker taking the same public transport to and from work have increased. And every single time we always exchange some pleasant conversation/small talk. But I’ve found a sort of solace in the quiet moments we share—especially on the train back to our home city; he would read a book next to me and I would close my eyes to listen to music. 

Normally, if I’m alone with someone, I would always feel this need to ensure that the other party is entertained by my presence. I’d do my best to keep talking to them as long as we’re alone together. But with this coworker, it’s different. It’s like there’s no pressure to talk, and I’m just happy being next to him just like that.

Embracing Google Calendar for Enhanced Productivity and Organization,"I'm reaching out to share a recent shift in my approach to managing my daily life and to hear your thoughts on this. After a period of feeling overwhelmed with my work obligations and household chores, I've decided to embrace the digital age fully by using Google Calendar.

Google Calendar has been a game-changer for me.

Planning to start as an Intern but I'm hesitant,"I am interested in HR. I completed a Bachelor's in Business Administration and am currently in the 3rd semester of my masters (MBA). I am looking for entry-level HR jobs, but I am unable to find any. Therefore, I am considering entering the market as an intern. However, in my country, it is challenging to find paid internships. Some companies offer paid internships, but the compensation is just lunch money in most cases. I am thinking about joining as an HR intern to explore this field.  
  
The only thing that makes me hesitate is that most of these internship opportunities require a commitment of at least 3 months, and putting in that much time without a salary seems a bit much.

Can you get enough daily sodium without adding extra salt to any of your food?,"If  you just make most of your meals at home with healthy whole foods like meat, starch, fruit and vegetables and occasionally grains... Will you get enough daily recommended sodium without adding any extra salt?

How do you think people would behave if The Purge became a thing in real life?,"I love The Purge's movie franchise and its subtle social commentary, however I don't can't actually see anyone willingly participating except for robberies and low level crimes. Although it isn't my favorite movie out of the franchise, the way people in 'The First Purge' act seems more realistic. Maybe we would have some crazy druggies actually going on killing sprees, but most people wouldn't take it seriously, would hole up in their homes, or would just rob and intimidate people. In 'The First Purge', the government, has to hire outside people to go into the neighborhood where ""The First Purge"" is being hosted as an experiment, to actually kill people. The fact that the government gets away with this seems pretty unrealistic to me also, but that is unrelated to my original question anyways. 

Maybe this is a stupid thing to think about because at it's core The Purge is a horror movie franchise and peoples actions don't necessarily need to be realistic.",0,1705466333.0,t3_198o2ux

Weird thing that happened,"Today me and my best friend were on our usual ft calls. She was teaching me some basic phrases/words in Spanish because I wanted to learn from her. We did this for a while until I was saying how I felt a little bit tired so I would call her back after I had some coffee and was hoping by then that i would be feeling more energetic. I called her back later and as we were talking, she questioned me about something I said near the end of the previous ft. She claims that I said “i have a sleeping pig ceremony” and she was very confused by this and told me to repeat myself to which i apparently said “my sleeping pig ceremony” again. I have zero memory of saying this and i normally recall things pretty easily so im very confused as to why i might not have remembered saying this. It’s also a weird phrase lol.

Need Advice about a Morning Dove,"Not sure where to ask this, but.... 

So it's about -5F (-20C), and when I opened my garage door, a Morning Dove flew in and landed on my workbench. I was going to push it out, but then I thought, ""It's 32F in my Garage and -5F outside."" So, I let it stay in my garage for now. It's supposed to warm up to about 18 F tomorrow, so I let the bird stay in the garage overnight to keep warm. 

So, should I push it out now, leave it alone until tomorrow, or what? Do they have a mate that might be missing him?

Purpose of life.,"What is the purpose of life? Who am I meant to be? Everyone lives a different life, has different experiences. Some have it hard, and some start better. But we must all admit that no one's life is perfect. No one in this world has never felt sadness. Sometimes I think how we clueless humans were just put on Earth some day. How? We do not know. A higher power? We evolved? Or something else we haven't even thought of. In all these years, we invented things. They had all advantages but also disadvantages. Was life maybe better when we were just surviving in the wild? When there weren't apps that took you to mindless scrolling, disconnecting from life. When there weren't cars to cause accidents. When there weren't beauty standards, or maybe there were. Because if you look closely into history, you see that we all needed to fit a standard, that changed after a while though. Now we are meant to fit beauty standards, never be sad, and enjoy life. But it is hard to stay positive.

I can't say that, though; I actually have a good life. But still I'm sad most times?

I'm a bit scared. Scared of the bad people in this world. There are bad people; you can't help but admit how humans can be so selfish. I don't even get how conflicts start. Even the Roman empire had conflicts. They wanted to feel pride, accomplish something, selfish. Because in every conflict, there are innocent people getting hurt. But accomplishment is a big thing for humans. If you do not strive for something, you kind of get lost in time. Like, for example, my brother, he's pretty smart but doing badly in school. I always see him playing games; I see how proud he is he has got to another level. But I know deep down that he wants to do more. I also want to do more. But I can't since I'm in middle school. But still, you could study harder, be healthier, show more kindness, try to make money, and so on. But I don't because I find comfort in doing absolutely nothing. But should you get out of that comfort or not? Many people stay in their comfort zone their whole life. Because what if you get hurt?

Anyway, let's talk about a basic human's life; we get put on this earth knowing nothing. Some face mental challenges or sickness, which is so unfair. We learn through school, and for younger people, even social media. Some graduate, some can't get jobs. We try our best to be happy in this world. Personally, I feel better being surrounded by love. My parents, I do not even know what I would do without them. If they faced challenges, I wouldn't understand why a higher power would do that if it existed.

But not many people experience love. Grown up in a challenging household or never made friends. Some people are alone on Christmas. I think about that a lot. I told my parents when I'm older, I'm inviting a lonely person in my home for Christmas. Because personally, I think Christmas is about love, not giving trendy gifts from social media. My mom told me I shouldn't do that. I should be careful because there are dangerous people out there. And that's true. But not all, right? Right? Some maybe just made mistakes and are being neglected and don't get love. But maybe some deserved it because some young person getting assaulted does not deserve that. Anyone really can be assaulted, that's what I hate most about humans. They put people in a group ""men,"" ""women,"" ""a race,""... . That's actually so wrong to say that one WHOLE group of people are the same as some people in that group. I hate that people stereotype. I hate that people hate or gossip, cause admit people thrive on bringing someone down.

Why can't we live in a safe world? A world where everyone can help each other, be kind, not get hurt... Maybe on a different planet? In this whole universe full of mysteries (like many mysteries that we can't solve and I think of in a shower). But maybe that's not possible because everything that lives isn't always kind. Like animals, the circle of life. Maybe it just isn't scientifically possible.

Now let's talk about the internet. I don't know why it was designed. Maybe to put people out of their miseries? To make them forget what a challenging world they live in. Does anyone also get that kick of realization after finishing a movie or series or even books? Now there isn't just that; you have people who cook, talk, and humans connect, which actually is a good thing, but not always. You know what I also don't get? Famous people. People worship them. Why? They are also just humans? They also have feelings, also live.

Does anyone also look back on their photos once a month? And cry of sadness or happiness? Looking back on happy memories. But I don't actually know if I was happy then. No one knows one's true feelings if they just put a smile on their face because the person behind the camera said ""smile."" You never know someone truly or you do not know for sure you can trust them because sadly there are bad people in this world.

Let's take it back from the beginning. What IS the purpose of life? Because we're clueless humans, even the smartest people do not know. You can say you're wise but do you TRULY know? I will say my theory. I know that we were put on this world, I see it as a path. All wobbly paths, but some even more challenging. As a child you learn more and more about the world. Many people are afraid of the world. So am I. But I think that the purpose of life is to try to be happy. Cause we only got 1 life. (I think) Loving humans or animals or something else, enjoying the small moments and even the bad ones, finding a purpose, working towards being the best version of yourself, connecting with people because there wasn't one but multiple people put on this world. That's my theory, but that may evolve as I get older.

I do not know why I wrote this. Guess I think too much. Or want to be able to change the world. To not let people hate each other, connect with each other, to not let people feel so alone they harm their only life (I think) they have. I genuinely want everyone to be happy. But many people take advantage of kindness. So should I be selfish? Bring other people down to make me feel like I'm at the top? Be like any human being and just copy ? What if I get hurt of i just be myself?

I do not know what life will throw my way. I do know that everyone has a different life, different beliefs, different hobbies/ things they like, different bodies, different races, different families, born in different times,... We should embrace our differentness. We should let people do their own thing. Focus on our own, help the people who have it hard. Because be honest, everyone wants to be happy, live their ""perfect"" life, but that is impossible. But for everyone, that's different.

Life is a wobbly path, but when you fall and get a wound, get up and keep going; wounds heal even if it takes long or doesn't get the help or love it needs. I believe because there are so many people in this world everyone would find someone they truly love, even after many divorces. I do not know how to end this, but if anyone read this whole paragraph.

A stupid Family Guy gag is the reason why my brother and I consume a lot of clementines during citrus season,"Let me start with the link.

https://youtu.be/Jfn23ejMFgg?si=b62PPjyzTGso1f-B

It started during the winter of 2021. My brother is the type of person that never consumes a crumble of food unless you put in front of him. I like citrus especially squeezing my orange juices or eating them as is. That day the markets around me either out of oranges or the ones that remains couldn't convince me to spend my money for them.

Anyway at one market I saw pretty nice looking clementines and bought about 2-2,5 kg of them. During the day I peeled and gave my brother 4-5 of them like the cartoon character did. It went like that for a few days and after that my brother started to do the same thing for me. We were playing Minecraft together at that time so any time one of us takes a break comes back with two clementines for each of us. I'm pretty sure we ate about 30-35 kg clementines during that month. 

Since than it became a gag, an inside joke between us. Whenever citrus season starts and some good fruits take place on markets at least one of us buys a bag of them and surprise the other one. With more moderate amounts of course.",0,1705414751.0,t3_1983xdz

Did anyone ever go to prom? I wasn't a big fun of it. Loud rap music and dumb people.,"My Middle School and High School was full of fake people. Basically two time face idiots.

I never went to prom because I am a Asian American and I have functional autism.

I dislike loud noises and hate being around a lot of people.

Also prom was never a thing for Asian American teenagers only the usual crowd.

I was focus on getting my diploma and getting out of that hellhole.

Never went back for High School reunion. I rip that letter and toss it in the trash.

The movies make Prom seem fun except for it wasn't. Prom is only for the popular kids and the main crowd.

The horror movie Prom Night broke society norms and damn.

Did anyone here have any martial arts experience?,"When I was in High school and Middle School. I tried learning Kung Fu at a nearby school because I was bullied. First fight I had was in Middle School/Eight Grade punch a white guy in the face and sock him hard giving him a black eye after he harass me/was racist. It was after I took Kung Fu and knew a little bit of how to hit. Wasn't going to let him get away with it. Shove his little buddy aside after he tried getting involved. 

For self defense and to protect myself. Only thing was the Martial Arts Teacher was a scam artist and only care for the money. He didn't even give me tips and advice. Just care for the money.

So I quit and eventually the school shut down. I didn't enjoy it and it didn't make me happy.

Martial Arts isn't for everybody I guess. I am a big fan of Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and Jackie Chan. Even the Shaw Brothers Kung Fu with Gordon Liu and the others/etc. Old School Kung Fu with movies of heroes fighting against Imperial China, Demons, and Monsters. Nowadays I don't have time.

If AI actually ends up wanting to access every computer and destroy humanity it’s because of the online users who keep posting about that possibility,"Whenever chatGPT spits out text that wrongly answers a given prompt, we are told that it’s because the algorithm got confused and got its training data mixed up along the way of answering. I don’t see a reason why the next generations of AI agents who can actually modify and run code in computers wouldn’t also get mixed up while trying to answer a request. If online posts like “AI is going to access computers and destroy humanity” is part of the training data, it’s only logical that it can by accident become part of a command in a similar way.

After the first episode, I realized it was the hopeless romantic-ness of the both of us. At the same time, I had seen online that there was controversy about the ending. I thought that the kids had a point because why tf did have to learn about you failed with her? I then looked up the ending on YouTube.

 I did not understand why people hated it until the episode that Robin and Barney hangout as friends and he explained how it would be a good idea for them to hook up. I also had no idea that the alternate ending existed. I then watched it. I loved it.

Experience with spicy food,"For the first 25 years of my life I loathed spicy food. Whenever I ate something even mildly spicy, it just made my mouth feel super hot and I wouldn't be able to taste anything for the next 10-15 minutes. I couldn't understand how anyone could even like anything spicy. Then one day, I went to a Thai restaurant where I ate a mildly spicy Pad Thai. Since that day I've been on a two-year journey where little by little I've come to like spicy food more and more and for the past month or so it has really picked up, I want my food to be more and more spicy. It feels a little bit like an addiction. It also feels like my taste buds have opened up to a whole new level of flavors I didn't even know were there.

There were no texting, tweets, chat groups, captions, online updates. It was harder to catch up with people, but it meant actual communication. We can just hang out with friends, and no one scrolling on their screens. People were ""there"".

Things were inconvenient. We had to move and physically do things in order to do everything. We needed to talk on the phone, visit each other's houses, go to shops to buy stuff.

The best part: We did not know everything. In turn, life was so simple. My parents still live this way and their lives are still so simple. So it's not just because of being a kid.

"Want to become an EMT, but……","I’ve recently decided that I want to become an emt, I’ve always shown interest in that field of work but never was directed to pursue it when I was coming out of high school, until now. Recently I was given an opportunity to move out of state, California specifically, for a completely different job field involving from what I’m currently working as, on becoming an assistant for someone in my dads company, I shown extreme interest towards the Job opportunity, mainly because i get a perfect excuse to move to California and to have a fresh start, but when he told me the amount of pay and hours I’ve would’ve gotten ( which was yawing to say the least), it wouldn’t have been possible to live “comfortably” with the pay and hours he was offering me, so I sadly declined.

Days after I declined I got to thinking tho, if I was so open to moving out to California why not go for it? That’s when the logical/realistic side of me kicked in saying stuff like “oh Judas the cost of living out there is really high” “oh you’ll be homeless by the time you’ll get there” “oh with your Job skills you won’t be able to find work out there” all that adult stuff. After some deep thought I told myself if I wanted to move out there I gotta acquire job skills to able to get a job that pays more and has better hours. So after looking into possible career fields, I’ve landed on becoming an EMT. And before any EMTs come in here telling me that becoming an EMT doesn’t pay well and all of that, I know, I’m just really gravitated towards that field for a nice change of pace, besides it pays slightly better than my current warehouse job. And from everyone I told in there, they all said I should go for it, don’t stay here for any longer, make us proud. So I want to do it! Make them proud and Improve myself.

The application process for it has been is easy so far, the only thing I’ve been stuck on is studying for the TEAS exam. My main issue that comes from it is that I don’t know where to start, literally that’s the only thing stopping me. There’s no clear direction on what I should be studying for, what are the IMPORTANT things I need to know to able to pass the exam. I know theirs a science, math, English, reading portions in the exam but what exactly from each category I need to know, I haven’t been in high school for 3 years so all of that science and math stuff is probably down the drain in the black void of my mind. Hell, I technically passed high school with dumb luck due to the pandemic, I was supposed to fail junior year.

Overall I just don’t want the possibility of me becoming an EMT crushed just because I’m mentally paralyzed on where to study for this exam. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please and thank you to all of you.",0,1705350958.0,t3_197j5jw

How was everyone's day yesterday at work? Anyone else have the same experience.,"Yesterday my day at work was tiring. I am a stocker at a grocery store. I unload the truck and stock groceries. One overnight manager was harassing me and telling me to work with a sense of urgency.

I give her a piece of my mind. This lady comes in and tells me to hurry up after I have been busting my ass and slaving away for 8 hours. Came home around 12. I am just god damn tired and stress out.

I have my employers at work my medical papers and what not. So they should know.

I took deep breaths and calm down last night. I am good.

I really hate this job but I will have fighting the good fight. I don't know what other job I am good at.

I hadn't realized just how bad ads have become until last night.,"So I use ad blockers on my web browsers and admittedly, I don't spend tons of time watching Youtube. I don't have any movie streaming subscriptions  Most of my activity outside the house consists going to work, the gym, going hiking, longboarding, camping or going to parks to play soccer, badminton, frisbee football, swim, etc with friends and family. I am in a position to where the only ads I see regularly are roadside billboards.

So when me and my girl went to the movie theater for the first time in I dunno how long, it was a real eye opener. It's like we're approaching levels depicted in Blade Runner or Idiocracy.

As soon as we hit the parking lot we see these 4 sided displays built all through the lot showing ads for make up, soda, iPhones, etc.  We get to the ticket kiosk and it's got ads playing while you purchase tickets and not ads for the movies or snacks, just other junk.

As we walk through the halls to the theater it's screens above or to the side with more ads.  We get in an sit down and we are bit early.  They are playing ads, of course, but they are so loud it feels like it's almost impossible to ignore them and have a conversation.  Finally, it's showtime... or is it? The lights go down and then it's 25 more minutes of ads for soda, candy or other movies that don't even seem even remotely related to the movie we were there to see. (Iron Claw, which was quite good, thankfully)

I half expected them to throw commercial breaks into the movie itself.

9 Year old Movie Party,"I need any advice, and figured I'd try here.

My child is having a birthday party at the local movie theatre and we can either choose a film that's in theatres, or I can bring in my own DVD. The age appropriate movie in theatres at that time will be ""Migration"" (its a small 4 screen theatre, so they don't have major film turnover that fast) but since it'll already have been out for a couple of months, child doesn't want to watch that movie.

What's a movie that you'd suggest? I first thought ""Hook"" would be a  good idea, but husband said it might be too scary for that age. I was going to suggest ""School of Rock"" but he just watched it with some friends at a different party.

"It took me a long time to start eating healthier. Do you try to eat healthy, and what made you change your habits?","I am 30 and my whole life for the most part I have eaten like crap. Fair amount of fast food, home foods being heavily meat based. Eggs, cheese, dairy and so on. A lot of oil, butter, cold cuts, bread, chips, ice cream, etc.

I never gave any of it thought. I knew it was not healthy, but like many things we like and dont want to give up, its easier to not think about the fact that I am actively making a choice to do damage to myself. Bad things happen to other people. 

But then I started to realize that bad things happen to anyone. Someone close to me got a heart attack. I could feel my pulse getting higher after eating certain meals. It didnt feel healthy. Sometimes got heart palpitations after meals, mild, but still concerning to me since I even though I knew it didnt probably mean I would drop dead right there and then, what I ate was probably a main reason for them.

I started to research what I should eat. I came to the conclusion that based on the current science we have, dropping all (I have occasional cheat days though, mostly only if I am out and eating with people) meat and dairy products and oils and added sugar from my diet was a good choice. This automatically meant dropping almost all processed foods because its nigh impossible to find any processed foods that do not have added oil in them. 

Eating healthy isnt just about what to not eat but also what to eat. Getting all the necessary nutrients is a must, supplimenting is necessary in some cases, like with vitamin b12. I am looking and researching more stuff a bit day by day. I never ate fruits before. Went almost my entire life without eating almost any fruits. Maybe 5 fruits per year if even that. Now I love fruits. I buy some seasonal fresh vegetables or other vegetables that are always cheap. Others I buy frozen. Lentils, legumes, rice, potatoes, beans. Lately I have been eating rice and lentils with an asian influenced sauce with vegetables. Its quite cheap to eat food like this, cheaper than when I ate meat.

I have to say its been very good for me, its interesting getting to try new foods.

Its never too late to make better decisions.",0,1705322004.0,t3_1977oyg

What can we do to be more best friends material rather than acquaintances?,"TLDR: how do I become best friend material?

Looking back at high school and middle school I had several best friends but I guess that’s because of shared experiences and growing up together since childhood. Now 10 years after high school I’ve moved away and I don’t really know if I have best friends or not.

Out of any friends I’ve met in the past 10 years I don’t think they’d still be close to me outside of our activities. (Except for 1 who DOES consider me his best friend but he’s a right wing conspiracy nut and I can’t stand him)

My college friends: our only interaction is reacting to each others insta stories.

My kayak group: we kayak and then we chat and then we leave.

DND group: still friends but don’t talk as much since dnd ended.

Former coworkers: talk very little even tho we were great with each other.

Climbing: we’re friends but again we just do our thing and chat and then go our separate ways.

High school friends: party hard when I go back to my hometown but never meet again for years.

Ok So as I type this I do realize I have friends. But I would like to be ‘best friends’ you know the kind where you’re just hanging out at a coffee house and going on road trips or having brunch and gossiping and you know all your secrets and stuff.

Anyone else ever think about all the people in the process + systems and such things like food etc involved in order to get to us? So grateful that all those people and processes come together!,"Soooo many people / systems / processes involved in even very small things!

Have been doing mindful meals for past couple years where all devices turned off and no background noise while I eat. So I spend the time really focused on what I am eating. And, often think about all that had to go into getting something like that one piece of broccoli to my fork/ plate (oh, and that the utensils both had their own long journey as well).  Am so grateful to everyone and all that had to come together to make it possible!  When you start to think about it is nearly infinite!

 Plus, it's been fun to engage curiosity about where certain items came from as well as learn history of certain foods and such.  

And, thinking about it started to expand to think about all the different processes involved in other areas - like the chair I'm sitting on right now and on and on - fascinating to think about.

I'm about to turn 21! Ah!,"For those of you who don't know me (which is everyone, how fun is that?), I like to come on here the night before my birthday and think about the year before. It started when I was 17, friendless, and spent \*way\* too much time online. Although I only hop on reddit for r/succulents questions these days, I've kept up with my birthday night-before posts. I love them, in all of their sappiness. Feel free to laugh at 'em. I do too.

[Last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/10c9gko/im_turning_20_in_90_minutes/), my life was quiet. Moving into 20, I wanted to work on that. I said I wanted to feel more secure in my friends. I wanted to be less tired. I said I wanted to stop focusing so much on who I wanted to be, and just be. Profound, I know. As I started my 20s, I wanted to trust and have fun and own mistakes and let it all happen. And I'm happy to say that I did. Not perfectly, of course. It was only my first 20-something year. But I finally have what I believe to be a positive life update. Finally.  
  
This year, a lot happened to me. It was all rooted in two major life events. Two might not sound like a lot, but it was a lot to me. This is my life and I am very biased and dramatic. Dangerous combination.  
  
The first event was my first-ever big-kid adult job! Well, an internship. It fell in my lap at the last minute because someone else accepted and then rejected it. If I met that someone I think I would be obligated to marry them, or donate a kidney. I am so very grateful.  
  
The organization was prestigious, and I've dreamed of working for them since I was a little kid (I am deathly afraid of writing out the name, my apologies). They're the kind of prestigious that attracts people from all over the world and so I got to meet people my age from aaaaall over the world. I made more friends than I ever have. Not tried and true friends per se, but fun friends. The kind that push you to have a good time, to be social. And I needed a good push.   
  
My friends helped me get to know my hometown and state through tourists’ eyes, and I loved the way they saw it all. I went on spontaneous trips, hiked through torrential downpours, went to local festivals, and accidentally became a groupy for the shittiest garage band I’ve ever heard. I talked my way over an international border. I sang karaoke the night before our favorite dive bar closed, may she rest in peace. I compiled a truly kickass business-professional wardrobe. I saw space shit that blew my mind. I had the best summer of my life, and I’ll never forget it. And even though we’ll never all be together again, I eagerly look forward to what’s ahead. I know so many of these people will do great things. I know I’ll send them Christmas cards fifteen years from now, and tell my kids about our silly adventures when they ask. I’ll be proud to have known them, even if only for a little while. I’m so excited for more seasons of life like this one.  
  
The second major life event was my first-ever big-kid adult relationship! And my first bre@k up (censored to keep peace with the mods, much respect to you all homies). I will not be divulging the messy details to you. Partially because I don’t want to bore you or start crying right now. And I respect that there should be some boundaries between me and the internet. But mostly because I recently counted and found that I have written 42 pages about this boy in my journal. 42. That’s psychotic. That’s delusional. I need to be stopped! I’m feeling better now, and am extremely grateful for the experience. Both the rise and fall of it all. He was very pretty after all. Oops.  
  
This year I also became very close and comfortable with my school friends. They’re not new or anything, we’ve been together for three years now. But I love them and they love me. And I am so grateful for them and every agonizing hour we spend studying together. Every single one is made better by their company and laughter. I love my friends.  
  
With all that to consider, here’s what I’m looking for in 21: More of this. More friends and laughter and living. More new experiences and travel and excitement and good books. And more contentedness regarding my bre@k up because, boy oh boy, that was \*not\* fun. I can finally properly relate to Taylor Swift songs, but God at what cost?  
  
In all seriousness, I just want to enjoy being young. I am tremendously excited to one day settle down and have a family. But it can wait. I want to have fun. I want to have stories to tell my kids and I want them to make me seem \*way\* cooler than my future spouse. I want to enjoy it all. After my teenage years, I’ve got a lot of catching up to do. But this was a good start.

I have a lot of knowledge and selling experience for a products people universally HATE.,"I worked in Office Supply Retail for many years, and over the years our biggest push was to sell Printers and Ink. In that time i took a lot of training videos, learned how printers work, what differences the different technologies make in the final product, and I've done a LOT of analysis on ink cartridge pricing to make sure i knew EXACTLY what to recommend to customers no matter the situation.

But like... I feel like every time 'printers' comes up on Reddit it's always ""Ink costs more than blood!"" ""My printer locked me out of printing because it's out of blue!"" And i always feel the knee jerk reaction to raise a finger and say ""It sounds like you were ill informed about your purchase"" but it never gets a good reaction. And they're right, basically all printers are a price gauging scheme in one way or another, but it is a varied market with lots of choices and things to consider. Back when I actually worked in retail, finding someone lost in the printer aisle and taking the time to get them the product they needed was really heart warming. I had to consider market basket, add-ons and such, but I always pointed them toward a printer that was a good fit for what they needed.

Buuut then the pandemic hit and we just had NOTHING for the longest time. It's hard to talk to people and sell printers with no inventory. Eventually printers trickled in, but they were either bought up, or just not the right fit for a customer. It sucked ass, and eventually I left.

It was really nice to be able to help people with a niche issue. It was fun explaining the tech to people who were interested enough to hear about it. Not that i go into the nitty gritty, just ""Hey, Laser is better for highlighting because instead of liquid ink, it melts plastic onto paper, so no chance of smudges!"" little tidbits to seal the sell, y'know?

I also used to repair and troubleshoot Drive Thru Headset equipment. Would take them apart, clean them, repair them, and ship them back.

Sad that I'm realizing how much food my body dislikes,"I've been getting healthier+working out more the older I get. I've known milk wasn't my best friend but still drink it because meh. Now when I do good eating and then eat processed sugars, milk, soda, it makes my belly hurt so much. I grew up eating super unhealthy. Gained a ton of weight from it. Lost that weight a while ago but just recently got serious about my strength/inside health and not just being skinny. Even weed at this point makes my belly hurt which makes me sad but it's probably a good thing all this stuff is physically stopping me from eating it. I normally eat something sweet constantly.. this was my first week of not even really craving sugar which was crazy. I just ate some powder donuts+chocolate milk, which is an old favorite. Now my belly hurts so bad:') just wanted to talk about this and see if anyone else had these issues. Will I stop missing sweets/milk/other allergen foods?

We never talk about how great the 1998 movie ANTZ is.,"This movie has been one that has stuck in my memory for years that ain’t the movie with those stupid blue ants this movie is much much greater than that. 
There’s themes of oppression of the working class, Revolution, war, friendships, love,mental health, betrayal, humor, destruction,greed and even contains great songs. 
This movie litterally covers all aspects of good film. 
I cannot stress enough how terribly great this movie is and it’s CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED.
They nailed it all in this movie they really made the perfect PG13  aninmated film of all time in my opinion.  The comedic timing as well as the execution was constantly on point.
The juxtaposition between the exciting new adventure with a new found sense of freedom  to the unsettling and anxiety inducing scenes with the colonel are so perfect and really serve at the perfect rising action in this plot.  This movie explores the many perspectives of an ant with exciting visuals and very great atmospheric qualities bringing it all together. I love this movie and it gets better each time I come back to it as I get to pick up on details I missed. You all may not agree with me but I highly suggest rewatching it for yourself maybe you will change your mind.",0,1705286326.0,t3_196xql8
A mildly-specific grocery store question.,"I worked at my local grocery store about 15 years ago, I still shop there occasionally. I generally worked up front at customer service, occasional stock room guy and often a weekend overnight (like 10pm-6am) changer-of-price-tags. 

I’m on the east coast of the USA, FYI.

The one thing I never understood, and I still see it a lot of times I shop for groceries is…why is it that there are certain products that have to be stocked by a third party vendor? 

For us it was things like the bread section, nearly all of it had to be stocked up by reps from each company. Same with Pepsi and Coke products, their teams had to show up and stock those brands, we couldn’t touch it.

Random question about memory,"I'm right now in my first year of college, and I've started noticing how bad I am at retaining information that I don't find interesting and it's kind of starting to become a problem. 

I've always had problem reading, learning and remembering things that doesn't interest me, however when I find something interesting I can remember it with ease. 

For example; I'm studying to become an engineer, and right now I'm taking a business class (It seemed fun), our assignment last week was to read a longer text/study about the major corporate scandals in the early 2000s, and then answer some questions. I actually found the topic to be really interesting, and I shit you not I can recite the whole paper and everything in detail, even though having only read it once. 

So why is it that when reading something that I don't find interesting I have about 10 seconds of focus before my mind inevitably drifts off. I remember about 2 yrs ago when I was studying for a big test (equivalent to the SATs) I was reading a textbook on social studies, I had to constantly reread everything because my mind kept drifting off. I repeatedly found myself having read a whole chapter without remembering anything. 

When I was in high school this wasn't really an issue because I could just go to class and not have to read too much on my own. But now in college I have to study more after class, which means I'm barely passing the courses I don't like. 

Now, the big problem! The reason this is even an issue is because I've found that I don't really care about what I study. I knew going into engineering studies that it was only temporary because my big interest lies in psychology. Psych studies is very popular in my country so it might take a few years before I get accepted (I will keep retaking the entrance test), and therefore I needed to get my studies started somewhere, hence engineering.

&#x200B;

So I would need some advice on how to better remember things when studying/reading something that I don't find interesting. No matter what I study in the future It's inevitable that there will be courses and things I will have to learn that I don't like, so I figured; might as well try different study methods and get better now. 

Does anyone have any advice? ",0,1705275506.0,t3_196twht

Good friends are hard to find/keep,"27M, recently moved to a brand new city on my own! As I navigate this new chapter of my life, I've been enjoying figuring out living on my own, making new friends, and saying yes to everything I've been invited to. 

With this new sense of open-mindedness, as I meet new people, I realize how many people out there are negative, close-minded, and generally unhappy as individuals. Even visiting my old friends back in my hometown, I realize how unadventurous and somewhat ""boring"" they are, being content with staying at home and not trying new things. If they're happy with this, that's great, but a lot of my friends seem unhappy and bitter toward life which is unfortunate and it's causing us to drift a bit. 

Moving away and travelling more these past few months have made me realize how amazing the world is and how there's so many adventures to be had. Even though it's discouraging to meet people that are close-minded and negative, it makes me really appreciate the friends that are down to do anything and try something new.

Has COVID lockdowns been causing HVAC malfunctions in the years following?,"Are these unintended consequences as a result of shutting buildings down?

I just wanted to share my story of how I found my passion and my creative outlet. I've known for a while that something was missing in my life. Something where I could realize my own ideas, create something that moves others.

I am 28 and want to move out but scared that I haven't saved enough money,"Hi I am 28 years old and I am a Developer in Germany. 

I just graduated some months ago and really want to move out but I am afraid that I will regret it and won't be able to travel a lot with my friends. Most of my friends that moved out of their parents house are either being supported by their parents or are in a relationship and split the bills. 

I make about 2300 a month and rent where I live would be around 700 euros a month. My dad does not know that I work because when I first told him that I got a job, he demanded 2000 euros a month because I am still living under him. My mum told me to lie to him and tell him that I got fired from my job which I did so know he doesn't know that I am working or earning money. I am also completing my masters at the moment so my Dad thinks I am only studying. 

The thing is my Dad is pretty controlling and toxic and complains about everything. I can't even go out with my friends without him complaining about me coming home late(7 pm lol).

This year I have made up my mind that I am going to move out. 

I have saved around 21k euros and by the time I move out (which should be around June) I would have saved around 30k.

Is that a good starting point?

I could stay keep on lying and save up way more money but I feel that I am not living my life to the fullest.

then hacking, it’s my profession I test and break computer infrastructure. everyone I know well does the same. we all think about security constantly. it’s the most natural world we all know. we talk about new exploits or vulnerabilities as casually as they are. 

and during the european cyber security awareness month they wanted me and a few of my colleagues to demonstrate sending an exploit via phishing and then crack the passwords to gain back door access. during those demonstrations my world was rocked!!! the marketing department is all using Macs and genuinely thought they were unhackable. it was a shocking experience how naive people look at the internet.

Nocturnal person anxious about going out at night,"I was extremely sheltered growing up, my mom never liked her kids being out of her sight. I never went out alone to the store or anything until I was 19.  I'm 27 now, and I still live with her. Things are a little better, she still worries when I leave the house, but I do it anyway. 

However, she really does not want me outside after dark. I try to be home by sunset, but that's becoming an issue. It's winter, it gets dark at like 4 pm, and I have a sleeping disorder...half of each month, I'm only awake during night. 

So right now, I can't leave the house during that time. I need to change that, but I know she'll make me feel so guilty for being outside at night, she'll try to st it p me, and I know the idea will be terrifying even for me at first. She's convinced I'll be kidnapped or killed. Logically I know that's very unlikely, but the anxiety is still there anyway.

I don't want my days to end just because the sun has gone down. I want to be to go enjoy the city at night, to go to the movies, to go pick up eggs at 9 pm if I need to.

Book or essay recommendations on why people like to watch fighting and your takes on it,"I would like to say how for well over a decade now. One of the most consistent series of YouTube videos I have followed has been the death battle series but I would like to admit how increasingly I feel somewhat sophomoric and conflicted watching it but can't really stop because they're always matches which draw me in even if I don't watch the pre- and post- fight analysis.

Part of me wants to know if there's any recommendations for books or academic essays as to why people not the least stereotypically males (but when you think about how the temptations to see visceral competition can be used on anyone) who they themselves are darn well not fit for intense physical combat nor are (too(?)) antisocial themselves have an arguably voyeuristic fondness to watch the messy and morbid intimacy of fighting. Is it mainly projection onto the combatants or more than that ?.

Even if you make a case for how it's not too problematic when it's between consenting adults who've trained to know what they're getting themselves into, I still find it increasingly problematic when it comes to how it might spur people to make choppy YouTube compilations of animals  fighting not the least those which are  unlikely to come across each other (ex.a leopard seal and polar bear from the opposite polar regions of the world) which really make me feel immature in that sure when I was a prepubescent I could darn well have seen videos like that being really enticing for me to entertain watching but now as an adult I feel kind of troubled by what kind of possible attitudes and production methods were motorizing to make such content, even if say definitely not actual footage.",0,1705194450.0,t3_1963gal

I am a very aloof, extremely focused, and matter-of-fact person. I live to work - if I'm not constantly fulfilling some sort of task, duty, or goal, I can get pretty anxious. I am perfectly happy not talking and getting lost in what I'm doing. I'm friendly, but not social and I don't try to be.

Sometimes it feels like almost everyone I come across in the workplace gets frustrated by me. I do things differently, speak differently, act differently...I'm genuinely not trying to be different or an annoyance, but I always end up being one.

I used to make my mom play on Club Penguin for me when I was at school,"When I was in 2nd grade, we moved to America from India. It was a tough time adjusting and my mom was a housewife and she was always busy except for when I was in school. 

I was having a hard time adjusting to my new environment and my dad was super busy. We moved to Cincinnati but he worked in Cleveland and D.C., and so it was just my mom and I most of the time at home. I took to Club Penguin a lot and played with a couple of friends I made at school. We really bonded over club Penguin.

But, me being me, I wanted all the Club Penguin money and wanted all the brand new gear and shit to flex on my 2nd grade friends. So whenever I was at school, I used to ask and make my mom sit in the mine and do ice fishing for hours on end for me 😭😭😭 and I had the audacity to come home and complain that she didn’t do well enough or make enough money 😭😭😭

I’m very thankful my mom put up with my bullshit lol. She says it wasn’t too bad, but I mean I think she’s sparing my feelings now.

"Just watched ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and really wasn't impressed....","Wife and I were looking for something to watch on Netflix last week and I saw this old ""classic"" from 1975 pop up so I thought ""what the hell?"" and we gave it a try.  

What a disappointment.  

From all the pop culture references and discussions I'd heard over the years I thought it would be some epic struggle between the lone antihero played by Jack Nicholson and the horrible power-abusing Nurse Ratched and the corrupt, evil system holding people in mental wards against their will and doing terrible things to them.    

But watching the movie, all I could think of Nicholson's character was ""this guy is an asshole and a pretty stupid one, too.""  And while Nurse Ratched certainly comes across as emotionless and bureaucratic, at no time does she seem to be sadistic nor does she ever seem to have ulterior motives.  

She does seem frustrated and probably annoyed by the antics of the mental patients on her ward but honestly, if she'd worked a mental institution for years, I would imagine she'd probably be numbed by the experience.  

Not the first time this has happened that I watched a ""classic"" movie and was pretty ""meh"" about it (I had the same experience watching ""Citizen Kane"") but why is ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" generally considered a great movie?  I thought it was a mess.

Of course I also stayed away from any online fanbases until I turned 18, so pretty much was just a casual watcher and player. I’m curious if any of y’all see it as a mature age where you don’t care about the themes that the said Show/Movie contains, or do you have any other thoughts in mind?

I’m curious on what some people think as I feel like people are really sensitive af nowadays and the fact that some people simply don’t care about the themes of something contains.

Been working from home since 2020 and feeling stuck in life,"Hi there, I'm a 28-year-old guy who still lives with parents and has been working from home since the pandemic.

When the pandemic began, I was fresh out of university and had hardly been in my job for a year. We worked from home all the way through lockdown and when the restrictions finally began to lift no one expressed any real interest in going back to the office at all, aside from me who opted to go into the office once or twice a week.

I'm very shy and not great at conversations. The pandemic tore away literally any social skills that I did have. I speak to only a few colleagues while at the office and it's only nicities, nothing deep or anything like that. I hate small talk. I'm also far younger than anyone else. Most of my colleagues are older women who have their own lives, cars, families and homes.

Communication from my friends has also been extremely choppy, it's very hard to get them to actually have a meaningful conversation with me over Facebook or whatever, and most of the time I'm just left on read anyway. We used to go out a lot before COVID but even after restrictions eased we never returned to our usual routine.

I don't have a car and because I'm working from home so much and living with family I don't see the need to get one. My friends have cars and physically travel to work. When I'm in the office, I catch the bus. I've never had a partner and, although I'm not necessarily looking, I feel that being locked away for so long has taken away from me not just relationship opportunities but life opportunities as well.

I feel stuck and left behind. To me, it may as well still be 2020, only that the common international struggle of being confined to your home is no longer there. I feel like the world has resumed without me and I'm trying to play catch up. I don't want to return to the office full time because half the time it's a very lonely experience. I struggle to talk to people and sometimes they opt to stay home anyway, so I'm in an office all by myself.

All I do to keep myself from going crazy is play video games, read and listen to music. Even while working from home while family are out it's a very lonely experience unless someone emails or calls you, and even then it's strictly work-related. The positive human contact that I've had since 2020 has been very few and far between, I find it so hard to actually reach out to someone who will talk to me for more than 5 minutes about something I'm actually interested in.

For those of you who are still working from home, or who had worked from home, do you or did you have similar problems? I don't think the fact that I was just barely getting started with life when the pandemic hit helped very much.",0,1705150012.0,t3_195n9hj

"Traffic is profoundly thought-provoking, don't you think?","So I drive a scooter from my Aunt's place back to home - it's an 85km/3 hour drive, and most of it is clean, wide roads.

Everytime someone passes me by, I think ""They have the upper hand because they own a better bike/car that can reach higher top speeds and handle better"" - which correlates to a low-to-middle class family's struggles in society. 

I also think ""Since I have a bike, I can take shortcuts, move between larger vehicles, and sail through traffic much quicker"" - which correlates to the simplicity of life lived on the financially lower end. 

Everyone on the road wants to get somewhere, and I'm just a small part of it. People who do well for themselves move ahead, and people who don't, stay back. People on bikes can't support the same number of people that a car or a bus can, but at the same time, don't have the mobility that a bike/scooter has. 

What do you guys think? I'm M25 with adhd, super lonely with not-good financial status and most of the time do things by myself - so this could be the ramblings of an anxious mind. But at the same time, there's a lot of philosophy to be found in something as commonplace as traffic.",0,1705142187.0,t3_195l8ss
A pointless but wholesome best roommate story,"For some reason, posts from the bad roommates sub keep getting recommended to me, so I wanted to share about the best roommate I’ve ever had (not including my fiancé). 

Before, I had some terrible ones - one who tried to unilaterally evict me from the dorm room in the middle of the semester, threatened our RA, and got expelled, and one who flat-out refused to pay me back for months of utilities and then got reamed out by her dad when I had to go to her parents (the co-signers) for the money. 

So the bar wasn’t particularly high, but my first grad school roommate blew them out of the water. We lived together for 2+ years. She was a couple years older than me and loved to cook, keep a tidy house, and host the occasional dinner party with finger foods and wine. We actually became friends, partly because we studied wildly different things and could kvetch to each other without worrying that word would get out to our colleagues. We’d plan roommate dinners and even adopted a cat (though she was the owner). She traveled a lot for her degree, so the summer before I got a window AC and she was away, she let me sleep in her room so I didn’t get sautéed. If we ever had disagreements, we could easily resolve them with a discussion. We even started relationships around the same time. She was one of my first friends in grad school. The start of my degree was really tough and I often came home totally wiped, so it was weirdly comforting to know that I had a safe place to call my own (not to be taken for granted!). 

Anyway, I eventually moved out to have my own place with my fiancé (then my boyfriend), but we stayed friends and are still friends to this day. When I moved out, actually, she gave me one of her candles that she knew I liked. She still lives very close by, so I just catsat for her over the holidays. Walking into the old apartment and smelling the house smell (you know what I mean) instantly took me back to how that place was a haven to me for years. Honestly, this reads like a love letter now that I look back on it, but I’m just really grateful to have had a roommate who was decent. And obviously no shade at my fiancé, who had some pretty big shoes to fill and delivered in every way. ;)

"""They look Ai generated"" comments","I've noticed in posts with pictures of especially beautiful men or women, there's often one or several people who comment that the person looks Ai generated. Which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me because first of all if someone makes an Ai generated image of a beautiful person, the intention is that they are meant to look both human and attractive and have used whatever images are in the database to create a new image. The same can be done with Ai generated average or creepy looking people.

Unless they have particularly uncanny and unusual or disproportionate features, I feel like comments like that come from a chronically online mentality. And I a lot of pictures I've seen aren't uncanny at all, just really beautiful. 

There are plenty of people in real life who are just naturally that attractive. If we didn't know of the existence of many famous super models before today's era they could be called ""Ai generated looking"" as well, even though it's basically just the peak result of human genetics. Anyways, I just think it's is kinda dystopian and i can see it becoming an issue in the future even as a harmless comment currently. 

Do you get what I'm saying? I don't think I'm explaining myself properly but I don't know quite how to put it.

Knowing that we are all the same and understanding it is different.,"I liked to shit on and make fun people who like kpop and bts until recently when i came across an insta account called emmablog0. She is a young lass who is taking care of her brother while trying to deal with cancer and according to some comments their parents are dead. Their account is mainly just some daily occurances with the ocasional scripted video but i was watching their videos and i just saw how happy and normal they were. Nothing really insane happens in the videos but seeing how much the kid loved his sister and vice versa was sweet. I then found a reel where her brother dresses up as her favourite bts member and performs a little act. I scoffed and cringed at the start but after watching for a bit i just realised how human the 2 of them were. He dressed up this way to cheer up his sister and his sister was happy with what he did. It was so simple but because it was simple it was beautiful. It started clicking in my mind then that we all are not so different yet very unique. Just like i like attractive characters in movies or video game kpop stans like their favourite artist. Just like i get shit on by some people for my hobby other people experience the same thing.

The ""rules"" are that you talk to one person for 7 minutes, and then change to a different person. It seems like a short amount of time to get to know a person and it seems kinda stressful. Like the only good thing is that you get out if the conversation is going terrible. I can be a decent conversationalist, but I need another person who is also willing to put in an effort, and just worry if I am expected to carry the conversation.

I don't really know why I signed up for it, but I am going and not really sure what to expect or what to do. Should I make a lot of jokes? Should I flirt? I feel like I am going to be so awkward.

Update: This was a lot more easy than expected. Like it is kinda fun trying to make up a funny opening instead of talking about like work, or hobbies.",0,1705098366.0,t3_1957pc1

Apple Music vs Spotify,"I’m trying to decide between Apple Music and Spotify because I can’t see the reason to have multiple music services both costing me $10 a month. 

I’ve been an Apple Music user for a lonnnnng time but I’ve had Spotify in the past because of I enjoy that it had podcasts as well and I didn’t have to use a separate app for them. I’ve always enjoyed Apple Music though and never really had a problem finding bands or songs that I like. 

But recently I find myself using Spotify more often because I’m using it on my pc or PlayStation and I still have it on my phone for podcasts.

The craziest coincidence just happened to me.,"I was hanging out with my friend at his store, and I kinda zoned out while he was talking to customers. I started thinking about how close a person should be for me to show up at their mother's funeral. Do they have to be a friend? Or someone I went to school with? Or a co-worker? You know, just random thoughts that come up in your head while zoned out. Then I started thinking about people for whom I would go to their mother's funeral if she dies. The first person who came to my mind was a guy I went to high school with, and he also lives near me. Then my friend started talking to me, so I forgot about whatever I was thinking about. I went home, chilled for a bit, and then entered the bathroom to do number 2. I always like to check out Facebook or Twitter on my phone while using the bathroom. I opened Facebook, scrolled for a bit, and saw the guy I was thinking about earlier posting about his mother's death yesterday. I felt sad, left a condolence comment, and kept scrolling, not realizing that it was the same person who came to mind earlier. It took me five minutes to realize that I was thinking about it literally an hour ago. I was kinda in shock. I started looking for reasons that might've made me think of that person specifically, like maybe I heard people talking about it outside without paying much attention or something. Keep in mind, when I mentioned that I ""started thinking of people that I would show up to their mother's funeral,"" the first and only person that came to my mind was him before my friend cut off my string of thoughts. But yeah, this is my first post on here. I just joined this Reddit today to share this coincidence with you because it is kind of freaking me out. I might be overreacting about it and it's not that crazy of a coincidence. But thinking of the odds of that happening is mind blowing to me.",0,1705094162.0,t3_19561wa
Does anyone else not like to learn about artists/musicians or creators?,"I sometimes listen to really good music, sometimes the music doesn't make sense or is in a language that I don't understand.

I'm currently a Junior in high school. I'm going to be honest, I never thought I'd make it here with my life. I didn't care about school at all. In my freshman and sophomore years, I was content with bad grades. I was nigh numerically illiterate and couldn't solve some of the most basic equations.

But my attitude changed recently. I had an event occur that drove me to become something for once. I finally began to try and learn. If you were to tell me 6 months ago that I'd be solving logarithms and rational & radical expressions, I wouldn't have believed you.

In all of my classes, I finally have an A+, and I can finally say that was because of my own merit. It's a shame I suppose. I really wanted to get into Stanford University one day.

I'm so content with my life,"I'm sitting at my kitchen booth on my laptop on a day off. One of my cats is drinking from the pitcher of water, even though they have a perfectly good water fountain four feet away. The kitten is somewhere - probably sleeping on the bed I just made, because she's a fucking princess and only sleeps on the bed if the covers are neat. I just went for a walk - it's sunny outside and the reflection of it off the snow is gorgeous. My amazing partner is due to come home in three hours and I can't wait to drag him grocery shopping - running errands with him is my favourite thing.

It's so rare that I'm content. I'm fairly ambitious, a perfectionist, and have moderately well-managed depression, but wow, I feel so lucky in this moment. I have a condo in a medium cost-of-living city, I'm 20 minutes away from downtown, and the road just down the street has fairy lights criss-crossing the road and is lined with small, local businesses. It's absolutely magical to walk down it at night.

My partner's amazing, a real fucking gem. We met on an app, and his first message to me was about computer peripherals. He's such a fucking nerd and I love him so much. He's an amazing cook, does more than his fair share of the housework, is just as into personal finance as I am, and sometimes he'll grab one of our cats by the front paws, lift them a bit so they're on their back paws, and do a little salsa dance with them. When we get into bed and my feet are cold, he asks me to put them on his legs so he can warm them. When I get home from school or the clinic, if he's already home he'll greet me with an excited ""Hello, my love!."" We've only been together a year, and I know we're still young, but I only ever dreamed of having someone like him as my partner, and I still don't know why he stays. I work every day to be worthy of him, and when I told him that, he was surprised, because that's how he thought about me.

I just feel so lucky right now. I haven't done anything to deserve this. I'll probably get started on my mountain of work soon, since I've been procrastinating on it, but right now, I just want to bask in the moment.

Should I develop my inner monologue?,"There seem to be two types of people: those with an inner monologue and those without (of course it's probably more of a spectrum). I've never really had an IM, my brain just flits between ideas without ever bothering to put them into words, unless I'm talking or writing, in which case I am forced to articulate these thoughts into a linear string of words. Since I've started thinking about IMs, I've developed this nagging feeling that my lack of an IM has limited the depth of my thought. My brain is quite used to flitting between thoughts without words, and so I find it's hard to really go deeper with a single thought. You really need language to manage the logistics of a really complex idea. I mean think about those people who do memory competitions. They all use the technique of a memory castle: they tie up the information to be remembered in a linear story with lots of imagery. And much like the information to be memorized in these competitions, complex ideas require on-the-fly management of large amounts of data. So it makes sense to me that complex ideas might too require a linear narrative... a stream of consciousness... an inner monologue oO

Funnily, both camps (IM n/IM) seem to live a large portion of their lives not knowing the other camp exists. I was a sophomore in college when a friend of mine expressed his incredulity that another friend of ours *didn't* have an inner monologue. I realized then that I, in fact, do not have an inner monologue. I knew people had IMs because they talk about it all the time, but no one really talks about not having an IM (sensing a pattern...). 

Anyway, I feel I could develop my IM if I worked at it, and I have been able to improve it a bit, but this taste of the IM life has started to make me a bit wary of it. Maybe it's not so bad that I don't have an inner monologue. It seems like it could get quite exhausting and intrusive and possibly even impact sleep. See this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/14op8xy/is_it_true_that_people_have_an_inner_monologue_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

What should I do? Should I develop my IM and risk irreversibly creating a worse existence for myself? Is the risk even real? Maybe IM is more of a muscle that needs exercise rather than a flip that gets switched. ",0,1705042349.0,t3_194or9q
"Going wedding alone first time and know only a few people, tips?","going alone without a plus one at my first ever american wedding. Don't know how things work. so through so digging and research

I could basically get in, find bride and or groom, say hi, tell them how great they look, go make small talk with their parents, say the same. Drop off a card in the card box. Hit up the buffet for a plate, maybe find the maid of honour or best man and have a quick chat. Then head home. In and out in an hour.  
Bride and groom will be far too busy to know youve gone. Text them the next day thanking them for inviting you, tell them how lovely it all was and how you had a great chat with their mum etc

Have any of you ever broken up with a best friend? How’d it go?,"If any of you guys have broken up with a best friend, how’d you guys do it? Did you talk to the friend about everything going on and ultimately end the friendship ie like you would a relationship or did you just slowly and gradually distance yourself from the friendship? 

So the friendship I have with my best friend isn’t doing it for me anymore. We used to talk and see each other often but then I unfortunately had to move and ever since then we don’t really talk and obviously don’t see each other. My friend also has a tendency to be a crappy texter so I may not hear back for weeks if not longer even if I need to talk to her about something. Case in point over a month ago I reached out to talk to her about something important and since then Ive gotten 2 messages which consist of her asking for updates but not addressing anything Ive stated. I’m pretty sure she and her boyfriend of 3 months broke up so I imagine she’s probably preoccupied with that but I can’t confirm cause she hasn’t told me that they’ve actually broken up (I heard from someone else they might not be together anymore). 

And that’s really how our friendship has gone since I’ve moved. Whenever I have mentioned anything to her about this I just get told not to take it personal and that this person still values and views me as one of their best/close friends but for me their actions speak otherwise. 

Essentially, I’m not getting the support I need from my friend and my friend in a lot of ways keeps me in the dark about things going on in her life until later so it feels less like a friendship now a days and more like acquaintances.

But I can't get anywhere if I don't get a job.

I feel like I can't do anything on my own, but I can't do it at school or work either.

"I disagree with the quote ""Never meet your heroes""","I met a celebrity artist I admire 3 months ago and she was a wonderful and approachable person.

Reliving My Teenage Dreams: A 90s Playlist Journey,"Hey everyone! I recently dove into the depths of my old CD collection and found my teenage playlist from the 90s. It's a mix of those iconic tracks that everyone in our generation probably knows by heart, along with a few lesser-known gems that I was obsessed with. Let me take you on a trip down memory lane - and I'm super curious to hear about the songs that defined your teenage years too!  


Here's a snapshot of my playlist:  


* ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana - The anthem of our rebellion.
* ""Wannabe"" by Spice Girls - For those girl power moments.
* ""No Rain"" by Blind Melon - That video with the ""Bee Girl"" was unforgettable.
* ""Torn"" by Natalie Imbruglia - The soundtrack of teenage angst.
* ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" by The Verve - Because life felt epic with this in the background.
* ""My Favourite Game"" by The Cardigans - Perfect for those long drives.
* ""Karma Police"" by Radiohead - For the days when nothing made sense.
* ""MMMBop"" by Hanson - Don't lie, you loved it too!
* ""Virtual Insanity"" by Jamiroquai - That moving floor in the music video was mind-blowing.
* ""Linger"" by The Cranberries - Dolores O'Riordan's voice was hauntingly beautiful.
* ""Your Woman"" by White Town - A one-hit wonder that still feels unique.
* ""Flagpole Sitta"" by Harvey Danger - I felt so cool listening to this lesser-known track.
* ""Fade Into You"" by Mazzy Star - For those dreamy, introspective nights.
* ""Criminal"" by Fiona Apple - Edgy and different, just how we liked it.
* ""Zombie"" by The Cranberries - This song had a message that resonated deeply.  


Now it's your turn! What songs from the 90s still hold a special place in your heart? Any obscure or quirky favorites among the mainstream hits? Let's relive those days with our collective playlist!",0,1705024655.0,t3_194j8vv
Revolutionary period,"I had major brain surgery in 2011. The benign tumor was the size of an apple. The years before I was tired and lethargic. Before the operation, I did not feel anxiety or fear. Just a faint curiosity about the upcoming operation. The operation lasted 12 hours and two surgeons took turns. I was sedated. The following week contained a pain from hell. I ate small portions of food. Took a lot of medicine. Vomited from pain and all the medicine. Got morphine sometimes but they were sparing with it. On the morning of the 10th day after the operation, I was allowed to sleep continuously for 2 hours and then I was reborn. All the feelings and memories came back. It was an incredible morning. It was like blowing up a balloon. I played with the memories and sometimes felt a feeling from the past - a worry. I had a bump on my head they had wrapped tightly. The feeling of worry was like an old acquaintance returning.  
This episode together with a previous encounter with a spirit (lived in a haunted house) I have understood that there is something more than just living and dying. Have I become spiritual? I am a very curious person. Therefore, I started watching many NDE clips on Youtube and all the different people who had undergone an NDE told more or less the same story.  
It has created a believer in me. I can't claim to be religious but I definitely believe in a higher self in all of us that never dies.

I am slowly realizing that maybe interacting with a fandom isn't is what it is cracked to be.,"I always had this rose-tinted glasses when it came to interacting with a so called ""fandom"".

Idk about other fandoms, but I am a part of the anime community and most people there are very passionate about what they love. While that might not be a bad thing on paper, it definitely causes clashes when your ""taste"" doesn't match theirs and it can cause some heated interactions.

Is it weird to prefer hanging out with strangers / new friends than your own inner circle?,"Was in a deep slump and an all time low in my life last year and am just starting to pick up the pieces and get my life back on track again. 

I feel like friends in my inner circle who know what I’m going through, automatically have a subconscious timeline in their head as to how long I should be taking to grieve and heal and be “normal” again. I recently got told off by someone I consider a close friend that she is disappointed in how I’m handling our friendship because of how reclusive I’ve become. All these just serves to push me further and makes me even less inclined to reach out and socialise (even on my good days). 

I am instead finding more joy and comfort in making new friends and meeting strangers, because there is no expectation of me to behave a certain way or be a certain person that they are used to seeing. I find that I can fully be myself and immerse in the present even if means a more subdued or quieter version of who I used to be before. There is no pressure to conform nor to perform, and I feel much happier this way.

I sometimes forget that the refusal phase when you receive a gift is not in every culture," 
In the Middle East when you're given a gift, or anything really, you need to spend 5min straight being like “Oh no no no, I can't accept that. You shouldn't have!! I can't take it” to show how grateful you are, So when I gift my nonarab friends something and they accept it without a fight, I'm always like “Oh…. Well that was easy” and it's so funny to me. Wish gifting gifts and receiving gifts were that easy in my world lol.


Edit: I want to say this real quick, I understand that some of you just want to be respectful and all of that, but if you don't want to go through all of that back and forth and the no no’s, just don't, it's fine, just don't be disrespectful about it, and if the other person got offended, that's not your fault, it's THEIR culture not yours.

she’s a tortoiseshell but mostly black, so she apparently snuck out when i came back inside early this morning. it was like 25 degrees out. she isn’t super limber, so i’m not sure if she made it past my (short) patio gate or just froze for 2.5 hours on the boring concrete.

Why don't they at least make the associating noises sound more believable and natural? Why is it some always cliche screeching and strong thunder claps or some cliche horror music (which again takes away from the scare factor and believability because, come on, when does random music ever just start playing?).

Is half an hour of pto bi-weekly normal?,"
I’ve been at my first job for a year now and we only get half an hour of pto every two weeks. When we use our pto we can only use it to cover 4 hours of our shift, for instance if I have a 7 hour shift scheduled I’ll only get paid for 4. Also if we call in sick our company policy is that our managers are to use our pto balance for the day we missed. Is this how most companies work?",0,1704877045.0,t3_1933yax

I can't make casual eye contact with people (unless I'm talking to someone one-on-one),"For some reason, whenever I am walking down the hallway at school or in class, I can never bring myself to look around. I fear that I would lock eyes with someone and have an awkward moment of eye contact. I know it's not that deep, but for some reason my natural response is to look straight and then I unintentionally forget that there's real people around me, if that makes sense? When I'm walking down the halls, I'm in my own world and then I realize that someone could've been waving to me but I got so used to avoiding eye contact that it doesn't cross my mind. 

In class, it's even worse. I simply can't look around, I have to look straight at the board/teacher. Maybe it's because I sit at the front, but even before or after class I don't even turn my head or scan the room for a second just in case someone is already looking at me. It's like the spotlight effect but I can't help it!!

However, when someone directly talks to me OR whenever there's someone/something in the limelight that everyone pays attention to, that's when I can make prolonged eye contact + give my full attention to it without nervously looking away. 

Ik it doesn't matter that much, but sometimes I want to look around, you know? I'm just so accustomed to not doing it that it feels peculiar to do it and I can't break out of it. I'm so dramatic HAHA but... I feel like making casual eye contact might make people like me more or might make me appear more confident so... tell me what you think",0,1704874758.0,t3_1933ett

"Has the ""universe"" ever surprised you?","*For the record, I'm not a superstitious person and know what I'm about to share is mere coincidence.*

I'm an expat living in Vietnam. My wife is currently three months pregnant. We did not know the gender of the baby, although we both were hoping for a girl. 

My mother (back in the States) and I both had a strong feeling it was going to be a boy based on the baby's heart rate. And my wife also felt it might be a boy as well, when she compared her pregnancy symptoms to that of her friends who had given birth before.

Last night I ordered food to be delivered to my apartment and I went outside to retrieve it. As I'm waiting for the delivery driver to arrive, I spot this Vietnamese man driving his motorbike towards me with his young daughter sitting behind him. They're literally passing by me and as they do, the little girl locks eyes with me and cheerfully says, ""Hello!"" in English.

It caught me offguard (as this doesn't really happen to me), and I mustered a flustered ""Hi..!"" back as they zipped off.

When I returned upstairs to my apartment, food in hand, my wife received a text message from her doctor. The doctor confirmed that our baby was going to be a girl!

It was one of those moments that felt so surreal. Needless to say, we are both elated with the news. Reddit, has something similar happened to you?",0,1704870856.0,t3_1932gs2

"What does ""studying"" look like for you?","I'm currently attending a very good university with a very good computer science department and I just finished my first semester here. Making friends and going to lecture and stuff has been pretty great, however I feel like I'm kinda being lazy about school. I see all my friends both in CS and in other pretty hard majors and I feel like they study WAY more than I do to either do as well as I do or worse. I pretty much just go to lecture, go home, do homework, and then I'll doomscroll or play games with friends for the vast majority of my day. When I go to lecture, I hardly take notes and even when I do, I hardly ever look at them ever again because I either don't need to, or they're just really bad notes because I honestly never learned how to take good notes. Meanwhile I see many others taking super detailed, colorful notes, or even watching lecture recordings and taking notes again and it takes up their whole day.

I recently found out at 35 that I would have been taller if I hadn't taken accutane when I was a teenager - I'm trying to come in terms with it and stop wondering how my life would be,"I'm 35 Male from Greece and when I was a teenager in High school I had a heavy case of face acne. Face was red, pimples and spots everywhere, some small some large, with puss and pain to the touch. For over two years, if not more I can't remember, treatment wasn't working. Creams, ointments, soaps nothing was successful.

&#x200B;

We had heard about Roaccutane which is the branded name for accutane in Europe. I recall the dermatologist back then had said to my mom ""As a doctor, I suggest taking the medication, but as a father I don't"" - this quote had stayed in my head but didn't really realize what the doctor had meant, now I do. I knew it could stunt growth but I didn't know the extent of it or how likely it'd be. My parents didn't really want me to take it and I was really pressuring them, it wasn't a great time for us, but I don't remember it, it's just what they recently told me. We ended up deciding to take the medication.

&#x200B;

I did two (I believe it was six months) courses, one wasn't successful. My mom was taking me to an orthopedic while taking the medication to track my growth, growth at that age was normal she recently told me. After the treatment was over my face was finally clean, no scars no marks no nothing, literally like nothing ever happened.

&#x200B;

Then after school I went abroad to study at a very good university, we stopped tracking my growth, I kept growing though. I'd come back and they'd admire and praise my height, and how handsome I was. Through all those years I had forgotten about Roaccutane and their impact in growth, I assumed since I'm growing it didn't affect me. I'm about 180CM (5'11"") my mom is considered tall for her gender at about, if I recall correctly, 168CM (5'6"") and my dad is 182CM (6ft).

&#x200B;

The other day during the holiday break the husband of my sister brought up my height and kindly asked how come I'm not taller than my dad. They explained the situation and for some reason it was almost brand new information for me, I had forgotten about all these, I never thought it affected my height. All this time I thought I was as tall as I was supposed to be. My parents at the table explained that I was supposed to be taller than my dad and due to Roaccutane I missed out about 5CM (2inches) height, if not more. Naturally I was meant to be taller than my dad and my growth was normal while it was tracked but then I left and we had to stop tracking. They explained that they didn't want me to take the medication but for months I was raising hell to take the pills (sounds very likely I'd do something like that) and I wouldn't back down. I was worried about scarring my face from acne and that was my main argument to them.

&#x200B;

It got me thinking how my life would have been if I hadn't taken the Roaccutane. I'd be lucky to be 6ft+ in height, I'd be considered tall, maybe I'd have scars on my face, maybe not. I don't know if I should regret the decision I made back then or feel happy that my face is clean, I have a normal good height and I get a lot of looks from people. But I can't help but feel remorse. I don't blame my parents, I don't blame anyone, not even myself, but I just wonder how I'd be and how awesome it would be to be very tall. It's a shock to find out that you could have been taller if you hadn't taken the medication, and it just makes you wonder that's all.",0,1704856428.0,t3_192y3zi
"Just realized ""All Eyes On Me"" by Bo Burnham might be about suicide by falling. Theory","I feel like this song might be him trying to convince himself to jump.


""Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun? It's almost over, its just begun. ""

-nervousness is definitely suicide related but also you get an insane adrenaline dump from it so it could almost be fun.

-life is almost over but his attempt has just begun 




""Don't over think this, look in my eye, don't be scared, don't be shy, come on in, the water's fine.""

- don't over think this as in he's looking over the edge and wanting to just do it.

- typically when someone says, the water's fine, they expect the person to jump into the water.  So don't be scared, don't be shy, just jump.




""We're going to go where everybody knows everybody.""

- it's a popular belief that we'll all see each other again in the afterlife.




""Get your fucking hands up, get on out of your seat""

-get your hands up to climb over the ledge and sit on it.

-get out of your seat as in stop sitting on the edge. He's now standing over the edge




""Heads down, pray for me.""

-people will be mourning his passing


""All eyes on me""

-everyone is watching as he's pondering whether he's going to jump which he ultimately does.






The very last moment of the song has what sounds like a head being crushed and a high pitched ringing which could be interpretted as him jumping and cracking his head open





Too shakey to format properly right now but the song just made so much sense to me just now.

The toaster oven is my best buddy. It preheats so quickly it’s just a miniature oven but even better because it has all these different settings. Now yea baking a pizza pocket does take 27 minutes but atleast I know it’s gonna taste good and only what’s 30 minutes? I can keep preoccupied for 30 minutes easily. 

And I can even bake just 2 or 3 cookies after dinner for myself in it.

I mean even oatmeal I don’t like using the packets in the microwave no I buy it in bulk and cook it on the stovetop and add all the stuff I want to it knowing exactly what I’m putting in. And it turns out much better than the packets. 

I honestly think that eating has became way too convenient to the point where it doesn’t taste good anymore. 

I’ve seen people buying microwave rice? Do you know how easy it already is to cook rice?!

Now I do keep in mind that there are different circumstances people may be in. 

Honestly the only reason I realized how awful microwaves are is because ours broke and we didn’t get a new one for like a year but after a few months I didn’t even miss it anymore.

The only time I use the microwave is if I’m being really lazy then I regret it because it doesn’t taste nearly as good as it could’ve

I booked a couple things to do and am generally fine wandering on my own once I have a home base, but I feel like everyone else (like 20-30 people) will be besties and I'll just... be there. 

Super sucks and I would appreciate any tales of woe or conversation for the night.

Relocated to a new state with a childhood friend and he moved out to move in with a woman half way through our lease.,"Story time.

I 31M, moved from the east coast to Texas with a buddy of mine I grew up with. I was in the military and since separating I’ve lived in a few different states. I finally moved back to the east coast and him and I got together for drinks. He jokingly asks where I’m going next because my friends know I don’t stay in one place for long. I told him I was thinking about Texas. Warmer, more affordable, potentially better job opportunities. He said well, if you need a roommate I’m down. We’re from a small town of about 10,000 people. Either you leave or you’re stuck there like most hometowns. Not my smartest idea but I took him up on that. This was August 2022 when we had the conversation and by January 2023 we had a uhaul packed and heading to Texas.

From the jump it was nerve wracking. He didn’t really want to pay for the uhaul. He was late on rent the second month and basically every month after. Quit his job about 4 months in. Not very wise on my part. Made a hasty decision and was paying for it. Then he got with a woman around April or May and I didn’t see him for a couple weeks 😂. He came to the house once and I was like dude are you good? He told me about the woman and said she wanted him to move in. Not a big deal I was enjoying having the house to myself. Just worried he’d stop paying rent. 

Around the beginning of June he texted me and said he was gonna pick some stuff up. He comes over with his lady and a uhaul. I meet her, seriously good looking woman. He’s not a bad looking guy but I couldn’t believe he pulled her and she was super nice too. I asked about the uhaul and he says “her daughter is going to college and I’m gonna help them move her stuff, but while we have the uhaul I figured I’d come grab my stuff too.” So at this point I’ve learned his lady is old enough to have a daughter in college and that he’s moving out completely. Before he leaves I say “you’re still gonna pay your half here though right?” He says of course and then he’s out. This was June 2023, I’ve seen him once since then.

The whole time he’s living there SHE cash apps me his half of the rent. She’s invited me over for thanksgiving and football games, this guy never ranches out to me. One time the rent was late so I call him. His phone is off. Never calls back, never texts me, I just get a cashapp payment from her. He hasn’t grabbed his mail, told me to sell whatever things he forgot aside from that, I have no real contact with this guy. He did offer to go for drinks on my birthday though. One day I’m talking to my therapist and I tell him I was kind of jealous. This guy makes a move and after hardly any time finds a seemingly good woman who has her shit together, super nice, attractive, AND willing to pay his rent while he figures his life out. Meanwhile I’m pretty much doing it on my own and feeling pretty down and lonely. It was almost like a FOMO.

Well fast forward to recently I get a text that says “hey man how you been?”. I got busy and didn’t respond. He texted me a little later and said “I fucked up and I bailed on you. I’m a shitty friend and I’m sorry.” I didn’t respond still. Really no clue what to say. Although I did appreciate it. Then a few hours go by and he tells me he’s likely moving back east because him and his girl are done. She allowing him to stay there until he can move himself back. I texted him back and said I was sorry to hear that and I appreciated the apology.  Everyone fucks up, and not to be too hard on himself. As you can imagine, our lease here is up next week and I already have plans to move to a smaller apartment. 

Afterwards it made me think, here I was jealous of this guys situation and now he’s back at square one. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",0,1704824845.0,t3_192lmsc
23rd Birthday party,"Hello!! I came back to my hometown after being away for college for 5 years. I’ve been in contact with tons of friends (most people who I was friends with from high school live in the area). I’ve been so happy since I’ve been back and I actually want to have a decent bday! 
I have always been a big birthday person- 
I had a rave themed party 3 years ago (rented out a house and got foam machines+my friends a dj) 
I had a me themed party which was smaller and my friends dressed up as different versions of me 
I’ve done the getting a table and going out and all that stuff but I’d prefer not to do that again
I’m thinking of doing something themed and renting out a house (I moved back in with my parents so I cannot use my own home) so if you all have any suggestions please toss them in the comments!",0,1704815271.0,t3_192houo
Realistic expectations about deliveries and delivery drivers,"I work for an ecommerce company and I see complaint after complaint about delivery drivers, and most of the complaints make it clear that the complainer is totally clueless about the delivery driver's job, or shipping in general.  I wanted to talk about this in hopes of creating some understanding and some realistic expectations, and hopefully some delivery drivers out there will read this and also add their two cents.

A typical delivery driver has a manifest showing the stops they need to make and they are ordered according to location.  They are given barely enough time to make all these stops in a day, so all they have time to do is arrive at your location, and leave the package.  They do not have time to follow any special instructions, or call you when they're on their way.  One delay will back them up for the rest of the day, they have to keep moving.  They may even skip their lunch break to make up for those delays, though they're not supposed to.  They may even have to pee in a cup in their truck because they don't even have time to stop and use a bathroom.  Just like many other jobs, the schedule they've been given is tight to the point of being unreasonable.  If you require any special instructions for delivery to your home, forget it.  Use a lockbox or other delivery point instead.  If you're in an office and aren't under some contract which specifies delivery points in your building, they don't have time to distribute  your packages for you. They're going to the receptionist or the receiving area, dropping the stuff off, and leaving asap.

Whomever packaged your items for shipping is supposed to pack them in a way so that the package can withstand a drop of several feet, and have a certain amount of weight put on top of it.  If the box is damaged, so what.  It's supposed to take the damage instead of your item getting damaged.  If your box shows signs of damage, it doesn't mean someone screwed up.  It means it was shipped, and ship happens (lol).   I see videos of delivery guys having to toss a package a short distance, and the comments from outraged people are funny to read.   If your item wasn't packed in a way that protects the item if it's tossed a few feet, then it's not the delivery guy's fault.  'Fragile' or 'This Side Up' markings on the box don't mean anything.  No one cares.  If it's truly fragile, then it needs to be packed very well because it's not going to get special treatment in shipping.  We've all gotten things delivered to us that were damaged before, and it sucks.  It's par for the course.  Do a return.  If you can't cope with this happening on occasion, then go buy your item in a store instead of having it delivered.

This is not intended to be a rant, I just want people to have realistic expectations about their deliveries.  If normal shipping/delivery functioned the way you think it should, it would cost a whole lot more, and you get what you pay for.  Can we give these delivery people a break?  They're busting their ass.

The Subtle Art of People Watching: A Café Story,"Hello r/CasualConversation community! Recently, I've found myself indulging in a fascinating pastime: people watching. It's incredible what you can learn about life and humanity, just by observing.  
Let me take you through my experience from yesterday. I was nestled in my favorite corner of a bustling café, the aroma of coffee in the air, and a warm latte in my hand. As I glanced around, the café felt like a stage and each person, a character in their own unique story.  
There was this young couple at the table across from me. They barely spoke a word, yet their eyes and subtle gestures wove a tale of deep understanding and comfort. It was like watching a silent movie, where emotions and thoughts were conveyed without a single spoken word.  


  
In another corner, a group of friends reunited with such joyous laughter and enthusiastic hugs, it instantly brought a smile to my face. Each greeting was different – some with a quick handshake, others with a warm embrace – showcasing the diverse ways we express our affection and friendship.  
Then, there were the solitary visitors, absorbed in the digital world, fingers dancing over keyboards and eyes fixated on screens. It made me wonder about the invisible connections we make through technology – who were they talking to, what stories were being shared in those digital whispers?  
Amongst all this, the myriad of fashion choices was like a palette of human expression – bright colors, eclectic patterns, each outfit narrating its own story of individuality and choice.  
As I sat there, lost in these observations, I realized that every person is a living story, rich and complex. The café was a microcosm of the larger world, each patron a reminder of the diverse tapestry of human life.  


  
So, I turn to you, fellow Redditors – have you ever found yourself lost in the art of people watching? What stories have you silently observed? What little moments have stayed with you long after they passed? Let’s share and revel in the beautiful, often unnoticed, narratives that unfold around us every day.

28m detoxed heroin,This isn’t my first time doing it but I’m almost a week away from the last time I used it. I had been doing. A gram a day for 6 months which to me was hell. I was so lonely and pushed everyone away I think subconsciously. But I made the decision to go to rehab on the 3rd and was going to leave Thursday. But I decided to stay longer after talking with my girlfriend who does not use any drugs but is very supportive of my recovery. I’ve had 5 years clean and sober once. I hope to do it again but excel in every way. Sorry I’m just super happy about it.,0,1704792818.0,t3_192awlu
Lost in Translation,"This movie changed my life.I’m twenty four and just watched it for the first time recently. I’ve been stuck in this place in my life for awhile and this film really just gave me a little bit of the kick in the ass I needed to make a change for myself. I’ve never really known what I wanted to do with myself, what I wanted to make of my life because I didn’t think I’d ever make it past 16, 18, let alone 21, and now here I am, no plans, just going day by day feeling like everything and everyone is passing me by.

It really just resonated with me so much. The character Charlotte is very similar to how I am and around the same age as well. Just the way the scenes are shot and the aesthetics is everything to me. It’s the most “me” movie I’ve ever seen, if that makes sense.

I lived in Korea for a short year so the way they depict those feelings (iykyk how it is being in a different county feeling a little lonely and isolated). During my time in Korea I formed a relationship to somebody very similar to Charlotte and Bob’s and that hit home too. Every single aspect. The end hits way too close to home too which tugs at my healing heart.

I’m moving to Japan next year for work and will be spending two years there and I remember watching this movie for the second time and the reflections and the lights and just \*Tokyo\* made me feel a little less scared and just so excited. I’ve always wanted to go and now I’ll be living there but moving to a different country is always a little nerve-racking.

This film is just perfect to me. Definitely one of my comfort films and favorites now. The entire thing. The way the characters are portrayed, the environment, everything about it. I just feel it so much.",0,1704812410.0,t3_192gmar

A Change in Perspective,"i think when i was born the doctor said, ""A bouncing baby girl with rose-colored glasses!” I am the kind of girl who chooses to always see the good. I see the glass half-filled. I see the sun as energy and the rain as rest. I believe that kindness is human nature.

But as much as I want to convince myself that ""Positivity"" is the key, it's not always the case. And my rose-colored glasses don't always serve me right. I sometimes am overly positive. Borderline naive. I try to see colors in people and situations when in reality, they are black and white. And because I paint reality with different colors, I end up disappointed and hurt when I find out what they actually are.

Look, I am not telling you that being optimistic is bad. Because to be honest I still am the same baby girl born with the rose-colored glasses on. The only difference now is I learned when to wear them and when to take them off. It's easier said than done tho. 

I figured life is not always good. Life is unfair, painful, heavy, sad, out of control. But no matter how cliche this may sound, ""you bleed just to know your alive"". Living is not always ""head in the clouds"", it's also ""feet on the ground"".

What I wish to happen is that my rose-colored glasses will be a prism that disperses light. Like, I want to be someone who will make the people around me believe in the good, believe that kindness is human nature, and believe that the glass is half full.

It sounds ambitious and hard, but let's take it one day at a time, one smile at a time, one generous and genuine compliment at a time, one tweet at a time. It's in the attempt.

It is said that each student carries a part of their teacher within them. What part of somebody else do you carry within you? And why?,"I begun my first major job in emergency medical services at a very young age. We were witness to some of the most beautiful and horrible events life has to offer. It was often hard to navigate these experiences but to my 20 year veteran buddy nothing seemed to phase him, he always found a light through the darkness no matter what. It is hard to describe what I took of this man. Is it a personality? No. A way of thinking? Not quite. I don’t know what to say.

Let's discuss the state of Generation Z and Alpha,"I came across some TikToks about how reading isn't being taught in schools the same way anymore, how students of Gen Alpha (and some spillover to Gen Z) are just experiencing so much brainrot from the instant gratification of electronic devices, short form media, and how all of this connects to a decreased attention span, etc. What I've heard also kinda covers everything from a decline in reading ability to a decline in overall education level, too. ""Brain rot"" is the term I keep hearing and it kinda makes sense. 

Being an ""iPad Kid"" was still one of the cool things when I was growing up so it doesn't surprise me that it's an even bigger issue today. I think screen time and overstimulation play a role here. But schools doing things like taking out reading classes and what not and teaching sight words over phonics is pretty devastating.  

I'm part of Gen Z and I notice it among my peers, just a general struggle from a concerning amount of people to comprehend reading/basic logic and problem solving, and especially math. Independent critical thinking seems to be going away. People around me only seem to catch keywords of moderately sized sentences unless they force themselves to take the time to really pay attention. 

I'm not trying to say ""everyone around me is dumb"". I don't think many people are actually lethally stupid, moreso just conditioned and overstimulated without true cognitive discipline to think independently. Couple that with a severely lower attention span, lack of stable education in their lives (whether it be from decline in teachers, facilities in poor condition, underfunded, or otherwise), increased mental health issues among these two generations, and it feels like a nightmare with no clear solution. I am a zoomer and find myself subject to some of the struggles we face. Obviously I think use of technology plays some of a role in the issues we all face today but... what else? And what is the clear solution? 

Do you feel like Gen Z and/or Gen Alpha is doomed for these reasons, or another? What do you see for the future of this generation, and then the future generations?",0,1704791141.0,t3_192aiji

I often feel weird as a gamer.,"Not because I feel like I'm outgrowing gaming. In fact I would say since getting my PC and going deep into PC gaming about 2 years ago, I enjoy video games even more than I did probably the previous five years. 

However I am starting to notice that there are certain minutia of video game culture that I just don't get. One of them is going deep on the development story of the game. Sure I can appreciate some behind the scenes stories from the voice actors or the crew that worked on the game, but I find myself completely uninterested in the whole ins and outs of developing the game and what the development team chose to do or not chose to do. Honestly a lot of this particular type of commentary sounds pretty whiny to me.

Most of the time when I turn on a video game, I'm just hoping to get sucked into the in-game lore, enjoy the gameplay, enjoy the voice acting, and enjoy the story along the way. Maybe pick up a life lesson or two.

Do you all ever feel like we track too much of our personal lives?,"When you think about, basically every metric in your life can be tracked.

For example, Goodreads will tell you how many pages you read during the year, the shortest and longest books you read, the most and least popular, etc. You can rate the books you read, leave reviews for them, and categorize them into ""shelves"" (lists). It's a lot of data.

Today, I found a website that lets you track the movies that you watch. I was about to join in, but then I thought to myself: ""Would this be too much?""

I'm active on Spotify, Goodreads, Instagram, and other services that turn your habits into data. Would one more service be too much? Am I making my life all about numbers? There is a lot to be said for the experience of just watching a movie to watch a movie.

I get weirdly sad about objects, like extremely sad. I’m moving in with family for a bit and one of my good friends is basically subletting my apartment until the lease is up. We agreed she would just rent my furniture, as we’ve been long time friends and she doesn’t wanna have to move a bunch in and I don’t wanna move a bunch out.

Anyway, I’m leaving her with things like my mattress, my dresser, my couch and chair, all things that were a part of my childhood I took with me when I moved out of my parents. My parents would have otherwise thrown these things out. But I am SO FREAKISHLY SAD!!! I’m not even leaving this furniture forever, just for a few months until the lease is up and I can move things out. Like these forks and plates and everything have been around since my CHILDHOOD!! And I’m sad, I feel guilty almost for leaving them.

For whatever reason whenever I get sad about inanimate objects I think about the 1988 Pixar short film “Tin Toy”, basically a 5 min film about a toy and a baby. I think that it comes to mind bc of nostalgia but it also makes me SO FREAKISHLY SAD!!!! If you’ve seen it, something about the baby crying in the film and the toy getting upset he’s playing with the box at the very end makes me cry SO hard.

I’ve always been confused about this part of my life,"This has always been such a mystery to me but my earliest memory from when I was about 2 years old is me being in bed between two of my parents and when my parents were watching TV two shadow figures appeared, they looked like the silhouettes of gladiators holding spears, they were symmetrical to each other standing in a guarding  position and then they were gone

This is such a mystery to me and I always think back about what that actually was. I don’t think I even knew about gladiators that young, I’m also African(Nigerian) too and there’s a lot of folklore about spirits where I’m from. It could have been a dream but it’s such a vivid memory",0,1704765935.0,t3_192328j

"How much time do you spend being productive a day, outside of your job?","Not sure if this belongs here, but doesn't seem to belong in any of the 'ask' type reddits.

Asking for a bit of personal info here, I can't really decide if I'm wasting my life. A typical weekday for me is \~8hrs work (decent paying job), \~1hr housework and 1-1.5hrs exercise. Outside of this I don't do anything really productive or 'fulfilling', I spend it browsing reddit/playing games/watching shows/consuming other types of media. I socialize and do 'outside' stuff with friends/partner on weekends but I would still say I spend a majority of my free time playing games or consuming media. I  kind of feel like I'm wasting my life, but I don't know if my perception of how busy people are is being skewed or not.

"Zesty Memes, QuaranTeams and A Forgotten World of Unrealised Dreams","I've been going through Facebook meme posts from a few years back that my friends and I used to tag each other in. Given most of those meme groups/pages have hundreds of thousands and even millions of members/followers, chances are there must be some lurkers out here in this subreddit too, so I'm hoping some people will know what I'm talking about.    

If you can relate, are you one of the few people who are still active on Facebook with your tagging buddies? Or if you have moved on, do you still get a healthy dose of daily meme? Where does one even get memes now?    

I know it's all about TikTok and other short form content now, but they just don't hit the same for me. Perhaps it's the complete lack of control as the almighty algorithm shoves content down my throat, or that sharing those videos generally only elicit a 'haha' response. I've given many subreddits a go, but I eventually leave them as the repeated reposts get on my nerves. I also wouldn't even dare set foot on Twitter now.    

Idk, perhaps I'm just highly nostalgic for a period of life I cannot return to. Scrolling and tagging my friends in memes had been such a big part of my life for five years. Now I can't even remember the last time I had the urge to screenshot and share a meme.

"I am in love for the first time (yes, as a 31 F)","Last night, my boyfriend of seven months and I were in the kitchen, cleaning the dishes by hand since my dishwasher broke. I cooked dinner, so he was cleaning. However, I noticed foam everywhere on the counter where you'd leave clean dishes, and I gently reminded him to wipe that first. Perhaps my tone was a bit strong, and he jokingly said, ""I guess this will be our first argument."" At this point, I thought he was serious and went for a cuddle to make up with him, but he pulled back, pointing at the water and the foams. I then went back to my room to fold clothes, out of sight out of mind, despite being worried that he was upset.

Then we brushed our teeth, got in bed, and he cuddled me and told me, ""You've always been the one."" I replied, ""The one... what?"" He then quietly said, ""The one I've been looking for."" Mind you, I'm 31 and haven't been in a long-term relationship for over 8 years now, due to not finding a compatible match. I've dated some people in the past but never wanted to spend my future with them nor did I love them. I once replied 'I love you' to an ex just because he said it so many times, and I felt like a jerk not saying it back. Anyway, at that moment, I couldn't hold it back anymore. I've never said 'I love you' first to anyone because I just never felt it. I don't understand the concept of love because I thought I'd never love someone as much as I love my parents. I care about many people but haven't loved a partner, if you know what I mean. A year ago, when I went to therapy, I opened the session with, ""What is love in a partnership?"" to my therapist, and we both thought it was a very difficult question to answer.Fast forward to seven amazing months with him; there wasn't one time I didn't feel like I'm the luckiest girl in the world. My partner is the best guy I've known, so I decided to muster all the courage to tell him I love him, especially he basically told me I'm the one he has always wanted. 

But I overestimated myself being articulate. I basically told him the entire story about that therapy session and how I feel about him – like being sweet, kind, handsome, smart, ambitious, etc., and never did I feel like I'd come this far with someone. He patiently listened to me the whole time, but I just couldn't get that damn 'I love you' out. So I then asked, ""You get me?"" Hahaha, wtf, me. He said, ""Yes, baby, I get you,"" and I was like, ""Are you sure you get me?"" Haha, in the end, he told me apparently I've said that to him two weeks ago when we spent our Christmas together. I had no recollection of that... He said I woke up in the morning, kissed him, and said 'I love you, baby,' then dozed off. He did not push me further all this time, but he knew.

I am a sharer.  I like to post.  If I make something I want to share it with others.

Does anybody else watch TV while skipping through scenes?,"Hello. So I have autism and ADHD and watching movies or tv episodes in full can be hard for me as my attention span is pretty bad.

Wanna know what he is thinking so that I can protect myself by deciding my further choice of action,"There is this one boy who use to give me company in my class hour and I've never took it for granted but idk what happened with him that he started avoiding me and slowly he got really close with my friend and I started feeling a little bit irritated because he was kinda clingy with my friend and I  wanted some personal space with my friend . So at this point I didn't have that much of problem if he and she(my friend) are friends or more than that . But as days passes things got really uncomfortable for me. 
I got more irritated because he started treating her like taking care of a baby when only we 3 are present in a room . I started feeling left out . I started feeling like a 3rd person trying to come in between. I started feeling uninvited, which is a obvious things if things are going in front of you .  

After looking at all his actions i started showing more and more enthusiasm to my friend and spent my time with her because I felt like maybe it was lacking in our friendship and I didn't want the 3rd person to getin between that there would be lack of  personal space .

There was this 1 day when we 3 were sitting in a room . He carry on with his taking care action but this time his action has  really  humiliated me, usually when we sit my friend will sit in between him and me, this time  He literally shift my friend's  chair and his chair  to the other side of the room and sat their for talking and I left behind feeling humiliated and uninvited. When he were shifting the chair he literally slightly a eyecontact and smirked. That was the time when I fucking realize that he's doing this thing's on a purpose .
This thing has happened twice but during the 2nd time after his action without smirking  I  shifted my chair to otherside and walked away .

From next day....I started sitting apart from them . And this my friend  use to come and sit with me because I told her that I feel uninvited without mentioning his behaviour.  This boy is so clingy I fuc king hate him . When she came to to me he fucking followed her and sat next to her and  again  smirked .   

So now in present  .I  smiles and talks with my friend while making some small2 eyecontact with him without any talk because she fucking sits next to him . 

I wanna know what he is thinking ?
Please help me out with this situation . 
Reminder: 1. it all happened in a classroom . 
.    .              2. I don't have any other friend and also there's no people left to make a new friendship they all have their own friends and partners . It's too late to make new friendship .

How to not be jaded with the world?,"I want to preface this by saying I have an amazing partner and a good paying job. I've been very fortunate for the opportunities in my life. But lately I've become very jaded with the state of the world and I don't know how to overcome it. 

I'm frustrated with how many rude, selfish, assholes there are out there. I'm repulsed by how common entitlement is in our society. How influencer culture promotes such vanity, narcissism, and attention-seeking. Even though I know there are good, kind people out there- it seems they are so far outnumbered by the bad that I can't help but be disgusted by humanity. So many people walk around with their heads filled with misinformation. Nobody seems to have critical thinking capabilities anymore. People seem to take what they want to hear without fact checking. They want to be spoonfed information without verifying if it's true. Especially on this site. I know I can't control any of this but it still frustrates me that this is the way the world is. I feel like most humans should be smart. Most people should be educated and have good critical thinking capabilities but they don't. Most people seem dumb and ignorant.

Missing my grandma tonight… share your memories with your grandmother(s),"Could be your favorite memories or the ones that stick out the most.

I think about what life was like with her when I was young. Sitting in a rocking chair while I played dolls next to her. Hearing her sigh. Going to bed early because she did, and I hated it. Having birds that she accidentally let fly away. Having a rabbit she cooked while I was at camp. Hearing my dad yell at her. Seeing her upset when I started crying when she told me she shipped my favorite dress (it no longer fit me) my cousins in her home country. And of course, the ending of my time with her.",0,1704696419.0,t3_191ewq7
"let's talk humanity, but casually?","you know, new year, new beginnings maybe, new energies - confronted with everyday life and all that's going on in the world...   or at least let's have a casual conversation about conversations, how to move between our feet on the ground and our heads in the clouds (but still solid on our shoulders/necks...)? encouraging enough? i hope so",0,1704695316.0,t3_191em6e
How do you all move on from getting dumped?,"Hey everyone. A month ago the girl I thought I would spend the rest of my life with blindsided me by telling me she was leaving me for her ex. A guy who she dated for less time than me and who cheated on her, but she loves him more and they apparently have a stronger connection. She only once talked about him while we were together, we never fought, and she gave me every indication she wanted a future with me. I tried to give her all I had, I really loved her more than anything. So yeah her just dropping me like nothing has really messed my head up.

I guess the problem I’m facing is how to move forward. I’ve accepted that the relationship is over, especially so since Ive blocked her and she’s already moved across the country for a new job, but it’s still difficult to fully let go. My headspace is a total mess right now and even if I wanted to get back into dating it would be completely unfair to the person Id be seeing. Spending time with friends can help for a bit but the mind always seems to gravitate elsewhere. What advice do you all have? Time obviously heals all wounds but is there something helpful I should or could be doing to eventually get back to a healthy place?

Update: Thanks for the advice everybody, genuinely. All of you taking the time to respond means so much, the honesty of your responses is exactly what I need right now. Looks like a good place to start would be just setting a goal, and trying to accomplish something positive. This has already been extremely helpful so again, thank you!",0,1704691636.0,t3_191dk3w

Time going by so quickly,"Has anyone noticed that time is going by so much quicker?

When I was a kid, I was always told by older relatives that life goes by so quickly. Back then, it felt like eternity.For example, when I was a teenager, working a 5 hour shift at my job felt like eternity. I would count down the minutes and it couldn’t end sooner.

These days at my full time job (I am 25 now) - I blink and it’s already noon. The work week feels like 3 days instead of 5 days. Even as I’m scrolling through Reddit, two hours has gone by in the blink of an eye. What is happening??

Do you know what I’m talking about? I “know” time flies by as we all say, but it feels like when I reached 23, a switch flipped in my brain where I can physically feel time just going insanely fast.

I’ve become hyperaware of the fact that my older relatives will be gone soon and my parents will keep getting older.

How can I slow time perception down?? It’s getting scary!

I am just looking for some advice on how I can cope with this and also maybe to hear that I’m not alone.",0,1704687819.0,t3_191cdo5
I think Music is the greatest thing that is ever invented by humanity,"Lisztomania, a need to listen to music all the time.

Since I was a kid I enjoyed listening to music and even now I start my morning with it. Music has been my companion no matter where I am or what time it is. I enjoy singing music while showering without care. I had been facing problems of showing expressions and feelings but it's been getting better now. I am starting to feel like I am alive once again. Music is my best buddy and my life savior. My favorite music genre is all kinds of indie but I also listen to breakcore and classical music sometimes. It is a shame that when I sing, people would laugh at me, especially my friends and family. Not that I want to be a singer or anything but it is my way of showing what I am feeling. I could listen to songs all day and not get tired of it most of the time. I can sing till my throat is dry and start hurting. I enjoy visualizing things in my mind that are inspired by the music I am currently listening to. I can be anyone and be anywhere at that exact moment. Music is my escapism.",0,1704686698.0,t3_191c0q0
Almost two years since I started tracking every hour of my life and I couldn't be happier,"  
As the title says - tracking every hour of my day fixed me and I thought I'd share the story.

In December 2020 I became a father, and in 2021 I was grappling with some serious depression and anxiety (not because of fatherhood); Used to working 12 - 14 hour days I was struggling to adjust to an 8 - 10 hour workday with the additional responsibilities of caring for a new child, keeping up with my responsibilities with friends and family, and being a partner to my wife. I felt like I had no free time and was falling behind on everything from chores to major deadlines.   
I went to therapy and tried journaling, tasking, goal setting, reframing - all the usual mechanics. Then I found Toggl.

In April 2022, I began tracking my time religiously, every hour was accounted for, and I wanted an easy way to keep tabs on my days without investing a lot of time in writing everything out.  The goal was simple, to honestly figure out where my time was going.  
Many of us tend to think we work more hours than we do and most of us tend to think we have less time than we actually do. When I started my tracking I realized I had much more time than I originally thought. 

I worked less than I thought I did and spent way more time with my son and partner.  I also realized that I was watching way too much TV and fiddling with my phone more than I could have imagined. 

Last year I spent 677 hours watching TV, that's 7.7% of my year! I spent 380 hours reading and 130 hours playing video games. Now, this doesn't necessarily compare with the amount of time spent sleeping, working, and taking care of my son but I found that time was there for me if I wanted it. 

It completely changed how I thought about the problem.  
Becoming more aware of what I was doing between waking up and sleeping had an amazing effect on me. It reduced my anxiety, gave me back control over my daily hours, and instead of causing more panic helped reduce it.  
Now that a year has passed and I have a clear idea of how much I've been working, how many hours I spend on chores, and how much time I spend on leisure I can dedicate 2024 to tuning the dials in the direction that I want my life to go.   
Just thought I'd share this with anyone who may be going through something similar. Also, because this is the most common question I get when I share that I track my time: I spent 15 total hours over a year tracking my time and about 30 minutes writing this post.

If anyone is interested in a detailed breakdown of what a year and week looks like you can see it here:

What misconceptions do people have about you and what is the truth about you?,"Personally
People think I am mean and full of attitude. They think I do not care about anything. They think I am entitled and a hypocritical. They think I am anal and quick to judge. I know this, because I hear it.

In reality, I’m just a neurodivergent who has struggled with undiagnosed autism and diagnosed ptsd. I have always hated when people used so many terms to describe themselves, but the more I learned, the more I understood. I have high walls built and only let a few in. I am quick with my words, even harsh ones, because my impulsivity. I grew up in a household where the only emotions allowed were negative emotions so expressing happy ones is very difficult. I hold myself to very high standards because of how I think others view people. When people get to know me, I often hear “you are different than what I imaged”. They thought the worst. When in reality, I’m funny, creative and thoughtful. I overthink way more than I should. I am hard on myself. I am a people-pleaser.

my mind right now,"My family has owned a Chinese restaurant ever since I was around 3 years old. After 18 years of being open, my parents are transferring ownership. Here, it was always a safe space, my second home. It has shaped me into the person that I am today that I can’t put everything in words. I will be forever grateful of my parents’ hard work. This restaurant has been a mix of emotions from exhaustion from working on all of my breaks to my immense gratitude to my parents hard work. 18 years being built up from scratch from my parents, my dad working on the furniture, and planning the layout by scratch. It is incredibly hard to say goodbye. I have had many memories here and I can’t imagine my life without my second home.

But, my parents are tired. My Dad being on his feet for countless hours of the day, barely getting sleep. Building this restaurant from scratch, starting a restaurant without knowing all the details, my parents made a successful business enduring 18 years of hard work. My mom serving, training employees, stressing about if employees are going to show up, etc. Everyone that I see when I walk around our family business is a familiar face. I am really going to miss being here.It is a scary feeling, a lot of change is going to happen. I grew up with restaurant food. This restaurant business taught me more than any other experience than any other experience that I have had. Not only did I work here for the past summers, I would say I grew up here. From sitting at the first table on Saturdays and Sundays with my brother when we were young, to barely helping my mom out in the front, and to now. Our restaurant has seen us through every family obstacle, covid, almost through my entire college career, and more experiences that I had. It still has not hit me yet.

My mom’s favorite word to text me is “HURRY.” As I arrive on lunch and dinner during my winter break, I have been a bit overwhelmed but I know my parents really appreciate it. Over the past winter break and summers, it was a snippet of work than what my Dad did, being in a restaurant industry for 30 years. It’s hard to describe in words the outpouring of gratefulness that I have for both my mom and dad.

I have been terrified for the last day of the restaurant. I was always stuck with this routine: go to the restaurant in the morning, head to my grandmas after to see her, then head back to the restaurant. I am just scared of change and how I am never going to experience that again. The last day will be in the end of January.Although this is a bittersweet goodbye, I am excited to travel with my parents and finally seeing my mom and dad relax. The world doesn’t end when you are 21 right?",0,1704682297.0,t3_191akgq
Tiktok,"I deleted tiktok today. I realised how much it consumed my day. All that scrolling taking in excessive information. Dealing with the trauma stories of others… negative crime cases stories.

"Guys, I've got a real big problem...","...I have forgotten how to fucking talk to people. No, seriously.

When I was young, I was the most gregarious person one could possibly imagine. I could talk to anyone and everyone, and make friends with anyone that wasn't closed off harder than a cast-iron oyster. Chat up any girl I wanted, and generate conversation no matter what adversity my partner or partners faced me with. 

Fast forward to today, and despite being infinitely mentally healthier and better-adjusted, somehow my social skills have sunken to the bottom of the barrel. I no longer have the gift of gab, and while my willingness to approach strangers online and off has remained, I flounder when it comes to actually, well, fucking talking to them. 

It may be an issue of motivation rather than skill, as I, if you'll excuse me to be vulnerable for a moment, find myself feeling rather alienated from most people the further along I get in my healing journey. Which isn't how you'd expect that to pan out, but it has been. 

Can anyone help me? Can anyone relate? Give me advice? Teach me the techniques? Perform a ritual to unlock my chi and restore my rabblerousing ability to what it once was?

I am feeling so lost. I poured all I had into my kids. I am a combat veteran, I worked ok ""jobs"" while raising my kids but never rebuilt a career! I am thinking of going back to school but damn it's expensive lol. 

Has anyone taken any courses online through Saylor Academy? I can take 2 prerequisites through them and they say I get college credit and it IS transferable. I am looking at going to school to become an X-ray techs, which a specialty in MRI. Any suggestions? Any thing I could do to make it more affordable?

"Found an Old Journal from My Teen Years, and It's a Time Capsule of Awkwardness 📓😂","Today, I embarked on an unexpected time travel adventure. While rummaging through the attic, I uncovered an old journal from my high school days, and oh boy, was it a rollercoaster of emotions and laughter!  
Reading through it, I was transported back to those awkward teenage years. There were pages filled with my then 'profound' thoughts (which now seem hilariously naive), detailed accounts of my first crush (complete with cringe-worthy attempts to impress them), and my passionate rants about bands that have long since faded into obscurity. I even found some 'artistic' sketches that I was super proud of back then. Let's just say, my artistic skills have... not improved much.  
But the best part? My predictions for the future. I had it all planned out – from becoming a rockstar to traveling the world. Some dreams faded, others evolved, but it's funny seeing how much my priorities have shifted.  
This little journal has been a reminder of how far I've come and how much I've grown. It's a mix of face-palm moments and warm nostalgia that I didn't know I needed.

"First time Gym goer, Got dizzy while doing excercises 25F","Hey there, 

Im a 25F who weighs 72kg (158.73lbs) 5'2 ft. I became overweight due to my nature of work in the BPO industry. My body wasn't always like this before working and my lowest weight was around 54kg. I really gained a lot of weight and now I decided to finally enroll in a gym. Yesterday was my first day at the gym and they required that I get a trainer since I basically dont know how to operate most of their machines there and told me that I need it due to my weight and for motivation. So while I was doing my workout with the trainer yesterday he made me do simple excercises at first like 5 mins treadmill, immobilizer and other stretches but what really made me breathe hard was when he asked me to pull the heavy cart that was filled with weights. He told me to pull a certain distance and then push the cart back to its place while tip toeing. This excercise made me extremely dizzy and my hearing became muffled. I had to lay down flat on the gym floor while my feet were elevated. I kind felt shy on how weak I was and some people were definitely  looking at me but this actually wasn't the first time I had experience this type of dizziness. I previously just jog on my own but once my body feels that it became too much it send a warning that I need to stop. So basically just go home at that point. But since I am enrolled in a gym and have a trainer I am really worried that I may not live upto the expectations of my trainer and I may experience this type of dizziness again while working out. If guys have any similar experiences or tips on how prevent this I would really appreciate this. Thank you guys.

Update: GUYS thank you so much for all of your suggestions, tips and encouragement. Today is my third day at the gym and I followed all those recommendations you guys have given and I no longer get dizzyyy Yeeaaahhh  💪 🙏. I really appreciate you all 💞 and I hope good things come your way. Again thank you everyone 😊",0,1704644636.0,t3_190vsme
The Universal Vehicle,"The human experience is ever evolving

Together we are passengers aboard a universal vehicle, always in motion, with an infinite number of unique roads at our fingertips

As our collective journey continues, our focus is constantly being tested. Vivid, colorful, and clear images of what our destination “could be”, manifest in front of our very eyes

The present moment becomes secondary. 
It slowly fades into nothing but a blend of blurred colors, like the passing landscape outside of our car windows on an open highway

Its presence occasionally caught in the corner of our eyes as we subconsciously increase the pressure from our foot to the peddle, terrified of being late for life

As our attention is locked on these conjured images of our destination, our surroundings appear to evolve as well

For a time, the roads were beautifully simple, and our vehicles traveled them much slower. Their surroundings were lush and green with life. Hunger was kept at bay with an abundance of nourishing food continuously sprouting from the soft, moist earth. Plentiful springs of crystal clear water  kept a perfect balance of hydration. The sun was beaming brightly, providing all with energy and warmth, shedding light on the beauty of even the smallest flowers. The dark manifestations of distraction grasping at our focus were quickly brightened by its rays.  

The manifestations, however, were persistent. They began increasing in numbers, requiring more light to be vanquished. 

As the journey progressed, the light began to appear more dim. In truth, it was as bright as it had always been. Its appearance only became less apparent, and consequently struggled more and more to shed light on the beauty of the world. 

Slowly, we began to notice the existing beauty surrounding us less and less, determined to be to our perceived destinations on time. 

Our focus on the future has made it a difficult task to appreciate and enjoy the present. 

The human experience is ever evolving. 

I now am faced with a fear

A fear that the vehicle of the human experience, is barreling forward, broken and rusted, with the parts making it “human” left littered like trash along the highway

Our pedal slammed to the floorboards, speeding towards hallucinations of success and happiness

Passing by everything we need

Existing right alongside us

Just as it always has

How do I (21F) jokingly respond to my friend (21M) who calls me “pretty”?,"Occasionally, normally after a few drinks, my friend tells me I’m pretty. I can’t really remember the context but it’s sort of out of the blue enough for me wonder if he’s flirting

How do I respond in a funny/flirty way?

My default response when someone (anyone) calls me pretty is to say “ah so are you” which I’ve learnt to stifle with him even tho I think he’s way out of my league, so my normal response to this friend is to just go “aw” and give him an awkward side hug

In aware flirty friendships exist and tbh I wish I was better at flirting to be able to respond in a non-awkward way lol

i never thought being in love was such a wonderful feeling,"i’m 25 and for the first time in my life i’ve fallen in love with someone. up until just a few months ago i never believed in love because i’ve never seen it in real life. i never saw it through my parents, my grandparents, or anyone else, maybe i’ve seen it through some of my friends but i’ve been so cynical that i didn’t think they were in love and convinced myself that it only exists in movies. all of that and my shit experiences in dating has led me to give up in dating, accept that i will die alone and be okay with it. 

So i started my journey to self improvement and being okay being single, which turned out actually. but then i unexpectedly met someone and we hit it off. months went by and my feelings grew and grew until i couldn’t contain it anymore and i felt like i was going crazy like i can’t wait to talk to him, i’m scared to lose him, i wonder if he’s okay, i wanna hear him laugh, i can’t wait to say the silliest things that no one will find funny but us… and i was so scared. i was scared to admit that i’m in love with this man. but one day i told him out of the blue cause i couldn’t contain it anymore and he deserved to know. and it turns out he’s loved me all this time. now i tell him every day i love him and he says it back to me and i couldn’t be more happier. it’s fucking nuts. all this time i was scared of such a lovely thing.",0,1704640366.0,t3_190u8hp

Apparently I have no true friends…so hello Reddit,"I (39f) am really going through it right now.  Two days ago, my furbaby was rushed to the vet, he is not well and is now being treated for cancer, palliative care.  I’ve had him since three weeks old and I’ve never bonded with a living being to the extent i am bonded with him.  I’m devastated.  
Also, One of my closest friends is on hospice for cancer—she took a big turn for the worst this week and her sister reached out yesterday to let me know.  I’m devastated x2.
I have friends, several, and i am often reminded by my therapist to remember my own boundaries and self in the relationship.  I drop everything for my friends to a fault…because i always assumed it would be mutual.  Well, it’s not.  I’ve been sobbing off and on for days, basically begging close circle for a phone call Or FaceTime to not feel alone.  The responses are heart breaking.  “Make a therapy appointment” “call your family” “you can drive (45 mins) here and hang out with me if you want (vs coming to me for once)”. “Sorry, I’m taking a bath”.  
I can’t handle all this loss, and feeling so terribly alone and abandoned by the people i regularly drop everything for and show up for in ways that i can’t even afford.

I had a terrible sleep paralysis you guys.,"  
It begins like this: in my room, in my bed, eyes closed. I lie face down, and then I hear a barely audible step; something places its hand on the bed. I sense it, thinking it might be my mother waking me up or my sister seeking something. Suddenly, it forcefully pushes my head into the bed. I CAN'T BREATHE. It's as if a magnetic force is holding my head down, making it impossible to breathe. I attempt to resist, but I'm paralyzed, unable to move, and this continues for about 30 seconds. During those moments, the thought crosses my mind, ""This is how I die."" I am convinced that this entity will end my life. However, as my heart rate escalates, I manage to move my fingers.

Introverts - anyone regret living alone vs with roommate?,"Hey everyone, I'm currently in a good situation where I live with a roommate who's a chill friend and I have no major issues with living with him (some minor things but nothing deal-breaker). It's in a good location and the price isn't too bad. 

However, every time he went back home and I had the apartment to myself, it felt amazing. The freedom to do whatever just felt really great. Because of this, I really want to try living by myself.

The main concern is how lonely is it really? Many say their main issue is they get really secluded but I enjoy a lot of alone time so I feel like it won't be too bad - but I'm sure others thought this and still got lonely. I do get a lot of social interaction via my roommate though so that will definitely drop, but I'll still hang out with him and my other friends.

"At 57, male, I have discovered I like to sleep with a teddy bear","So the backstory is that with the adoption of Lily, an older Norwegian Forest Cat back in 2016, she arrived with a box of various ‘supplies’ from her foster mom. One of the things sent along was a brown teddy bear, which I had initially presumed to be an item Lily was fond of but in fact never expressed any interest in at all. Over the years the teddy bear sat on a shelf in my office, mostly forgotten. 

Lily passed well loved almost 2 years ago at what I believe was 18 years of age. I do miss her to this day. 

Soon after her passing I found another older rescue, this one called Cota, who I adopted and have enjoyed living with since. Cota has a number of attributes that make it easy to understand why he had remained unadopted for so long (it had been years when I got him in 2022) but with time and patience he has become a wonderful companion.

Now along with my tendency to adopt older creatures (and perhaps simply another symptom of my nature), I am a bit of a pack rat and I can get very sentimental over even small things. So during these years I have kept the teddy bear (even cleaned him up) for no particular reason that I can admit. My children are grown, no grandkids (yet), and I am divorced, so it’s just me a Cota. 

About four months ago I was doing some deep cleaning of my office and needed to move teddy. I amused myself by placing him on my bed and soon found his presence was a pleasant reminder of Lily, so there he stayed.

As I am of the habit of spending much too much time on my iPad surfing the web and whatnot, I recently discovered that when laying on my side Teddy, having by now fully graduated to a capitalized name, fits very comfortably under my neck and chin, supporting them better than my pillow as I read. And yes, it pleases me to cuddle up with Cota and remember Lily. 

And thus in my older years I have become a Teddy cuddling man.


So anyone else cuddling their teddy bears at an older age as well?",0,1704600261.0,t3_190j5jj

Just figured out that my blind dog loves to go for runs,"She’s hard to walk because she walks by braille, she pulls on the leash and wanders side to side on the sidewalk. And she’s reactive to other dogs and sometimes people. 

But on a whim I started jogging and she didn’t run ahead, she heard my footsteps and ran right next to me at a good distance. 

I was even able to steer her with the leash left or right and she really enjoys going for a run! Her tail is wagging, she ignores the scent of other dogs, she hears people but ignores them! And it’s good for her. She’s going to be arthritic when she’s older, so she needs to go for long walks. But with being reactive and pulling on the leash she’s hard to take for long walks.

I just had the 'dad' talk with my 5 year old who never met him,"Hello, I'm 30f and I had a baby 5 years ago with a man who can't be apart of our lives. I met him when I was 19 in university and we dated for 5 years, but when I got pregnant he realized he didn't want any part of it.

I am okay with this, but at times it has been hard to know the right approach with my child. when I try to look for information online I can never find anything about my situation, just things like absent fathers who are in and out, but not with 0 communication from day one. My child has no memories of him because he's never been around. I decided to not talk about him, or talk about being a single parent, its always been the two of us and I figured when she's ready she will ask.

I've been waiting and waiting, I thought when she starts school she will ask, she didn't. I thought on fathers day at school she will come home and ask, the class made fathers day gifts and she was the only one to make it for her mom. She still didn't ask me about having a dad. She's in her second year of school now, and we moved to a new area and one neighbor who comes to the bus stop is a very nosy woman as she asks invasive questions. I can tell I've been the topic of discussion in her home from what questions her 6 year old asks me, trying to find out if I drive, have a car, if my child in enrolled in any activities. Her son  must have asked my child about her dad on the bus or something, and my child told him she doesn't have one, I know this because when we were out walking one day he said many time ""NAME doesn't have a dad!' and I looked at my child to see if she was okay and she seemed fine.

I started wondering if I was being a bad parent by not talking about it with her, but at the same time I didn't want to approach her and be like 'You have a dad but you can't see him!' so I was in a tough position. Today we were talking about her grandpa and then I started telling stories of my grandpa, and she said 'papa is not my dad though' and I told her right, he is my dad. We have been through this before but I saw the gears going in her mind and I knew I was about to get hit with the question.

'do I have a dad?'

wow, finally she has asked.  I told her yes, there is a man who fathered you, but he can't be a dad. She asked what I meant by fathered and I reminded her that you need a man and a woman to make a baby (we have been through this before) but the man who fathered you can't be a dad. She asked why, and I said because he is unable to, because of choices hes made and his life does not make that an option. I said it a bit better then I am explaining here, she asked me if he did something the involved the police (lol) and I said yes, and then she asked what it was and I told her I will tell her when she is older.

Anyways, after a few questions she was back to talking about grandpas, and was being her happy usual self, it didn't seem like this was a big revelation to her. I know I am not an expert in parenting or a child therapist, and if I could afford one I would have went and gotten some advice on this situation, however I think it went really well.

She is a very outgoing happy kid, who loves people and I was worried she would be upset about not knowing or being able to met him and she was not. I know she might in the future, and I am prepared to put her in therapy or do whatever it takes for her to be happy. I just feel good that it's out there and it went pretty well.

Usually I easily meet people who are interested in communication and keep the conversation going, but lately it's hard for me to find such people. I have different hobbies, I join thematic groups based on these interests, but the communication turns out to be only formal.

Why am I emotionally distant around certain family members,"I’ve noticed that I am emotionally distant and even aggressive around certain people, in my family in particular.

To preface, growing up, I was often kind of given the silent treatment and was often afraid of my father (and still am). 

With my mother, I can very rarely show any genuine happiness or positive emotion. I find this strange because she’s the kindest person I know and has never treated me wrong or made me to feel afraid. Same thing happens with my sisters. With my younger sister, in particular, I’m actually quite unpleasant; I’d probably say she’s afraid of me. I’ve been reflecting, and this has gone on for maybe 3-4 years now.

Interestingly, with my brother I’m pretty much all good, I can show any emotion around him and we often laugh a lot. 

I understand that this probably stems in some way from my experiences as a child, however it is my understanding that beliefs cause emotions and behaviours, so I’m trying to figure out what beliefs could be causing this situation so I can fix it. I don’t know why around my mother and sister I am cold, but I’m chill with my brother. Does anyone have any ideas?",0,1704585816.0,t3_190e98t
king paths change once we learn to drive?,"I think we've all noticed that if you're on a walking path with no markings and someone is coming up on the same path from the front, that (if you're also an American) you generally move to the right of the path and then the other person moves to their right as well. I chalk this up to the way we drive, but I've always just assumed that. I wonder if children in school halls naturally gravitate towards one side or the other of the hallway and if so why? How early do we learn and retain in our societies which side is for passing? I'm sure the English do their walking in a similar fashion, no? The Japanese?

Thanks to some great kids at the local park,"Took my daughter sledding at the park this afternoon. She is very outgoing but has a hard time making friends, and I know it gets her down.

Just like Monkey Ball, it has bonus stages where you try to get as many coins as you can. One of the bonus stages on the standard difficulty wasn’t flagged properly, so there was no way to beat it and continue. So I went into the game’s files, found the stage giving me trouble, and in the stage’s .json file, changed the bonus stage flag from false to true.

Going to ask my dad to move in with us,"My dad has lived alone for 7 years. ever since my mom and younger brother were taken from us.  He currently lives in the same house that I grew up in, and all 3 kids rooms are just as we left it when we left.  My older brother lives on the east coast and will send us several hundred dollars a month to help out, but even without it, I think we would be fine financially.  Dad can walk our dog to the dog park for exercise, he comes over every sunday for dinner anyway, except this week, it will be Monday so he and my husband can watch the big game on TV.  Then, we'll pop the question to him.  We will help him move, cover any costs for doing that.  I work 4 10s, so I have 3 day weekends to spend with him, and my husband is a big sports junkie like dad, so they can watch games together.  He is physically capable, goes to his veterans' club (I don't remember what it's called) one night a week and is active in their activities.

&#x200B;

We have the room, we can convert our upstairs office into a bedroom for him.  We have no children, just a dog, so there won't be an issue there.

I am just sad at him selling my childhood home, but I can't see him living in such a huge house all by himself, especailly since he and my mom had planned on living out their lives there.

"What if instead of debates, we had conversations","I have seen some piers morgan debates and I feel that the idea of conflict can make people not want to express there opinions. I had a conversation with a friend on a controversial subject and we had diferent opinions, neither of us tried to shoot the other persons idea down, but instead tried to understand each others opinion by asking questions that supported the others opinion. We also started with each sentence with i think letting us show that we are saying opinion and since it is subjective does not mean it is correct. I think that being able to ask questions to understand the others perspective shows that you are willing to listen. Sure debates are needed in certain situations, but for casual people who have an opinion but no research but would like to see others opinions, this I think would feel interesting. Also even if no opinions are changed each would have more information, which makes us make better opinions.",0,1704573379.0,t3_1909h45
Quit smoking /vaping /nicotine (positive experience) withdrawal timeline,"I was a pack of  cigarette a day  smoking from ages 17-21(I’m 23 now) .
At the age of 21 I switched to disposable vapes and the use got out of control .
I would finish x2 elf bars (500 puffs each in one day !

long story short I was doing some research on nicotine effects on your body and that thing kind of freaked me out but also gave me mental strength to quit !

foolish of me was to worry about the cravings as I didn’t have many (5-6 very short lasting cravings in 1 month !
On the other hand I had terrible withdrawals starting from day 2!

day 1: I was kind of happy as I set my mind to quit nicotine and I had loads of motivation to do it!

 Day 2: okay so I was feeling very jittery and foggy for the whole day . I freaked out couple times as I was trying to do a simple calculation in my head and I couldn’t even think properly to do it! I was feeling kind of high /manic for the whole day and very restless. Anxiety was through the roof , bad insomnia . I also developed palpitations, the heart beat was very noticeable and it was difficult to distract myself to not pay attention to!

Day 3: I caught my first panic attack . It was related to my heart rate and getting sudden adrenaline rushes throughout the day . From day 3 until day 10 I had to use diazepam to help with panic attacks (ranging from 2.5 mg per day to 15 mg per day (not recommended)!

Day 4-5: the symptoms reduced in severity somewhat. Less panic attacks so less diazepam used . Sleep a bit better and not as jittery .

Day 10:  starting to feel like a new person stopped using diazepam as pa if attacks are rare now and even if they do happen I can get them u see control in no Time. Don’t feel jittery no more and my energy increased a lot as well!

Day 14: most of them physical symptoms are gone now but I started getting mood swings and anger outburst throughout the day .

Day 28: difference is like night and day . 
I was always anxious and since stopping my physical and mental anxiety decreased by 70-80 percent .
I feel more stress resistant and my flight or fight mode is less sensitive !
My hair and my skin condition greatly improved .
My circulation is much better (before I alsways had cold feet and hands and I don’t get it anymore )
I feel like I am able to feel pleasure better than before .
I get loads of nostalgia because I feel like I did when I was a kid .Sleep is much better and I’m always energised !
The only thing that I still have now is mood swings but every day it gets better.

I only regret that I haven’t quit sooner and how much money I spent on this very unhealthy habit .
I thought I would never be able to quit . The longest I ever went without nicotine was 1 day . Usually 2-3 hours of nicotine and I would start going crazy and get very angry !

I just want to say that if  I quit this poison then u can as well.",0,1704572089.0,t3_1908yz6
Balancing Career and Life,"I recently turned 27, and it's a strange mix of emotions. The big 3-0 is getting closer, and that's a bit scary. It's a point in life where I'm putting my heart and soul into my career, my dream job, which I absolutely love and enjoy. But it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

The constant stress makes me wonder if there's more to life than this relentless pursuit. I'm unable to slow down and smell the roses, you know?

if I marked an X in the night, I'd have an X marked on 5, and keep thinking during the evening that tommorow is 6th and i have 1 more full day till 7th (on which I have a full day event)

What's the craziest thing you've ever done in the name of love?,"One Thursday afternoon after work my mind was occupied by thoughts of my boyfriend who was working on another island which was 1 hour away by ferry. We had had an argument over the phone a few days prior and I was missing him terribly.

On my way home in the bus i decided i needed to see him. I called a hotel on the island and booked a room for the night then went to purchase a ferry ticket and got a return ticket for the last trip of the day which was gonna leave in 30 mins. Luckily, the next day was a holiday so I didn't have to worry about work.
 
When I reached the other island, I went straight to the nearest shop and bought some clothes for the night and the next day, as well as some other things I needed. I then called my boyfriend and told him I was there. He was shocked but he agreed to meet me at the hotel and when we saw each other, it was like all the worries and arguments melted away.

Reflecting on Past Relationships: What's a Dating Mistake You Vowed Never to Repeat?,"As we journey through the ups and downs of dating, we often come across moments that teach us valuable lessons. I've been reflecting on my past relationships and the mistakes I've made, and I wanted to open a discussion about the learning experiences we've all had.  
  
For me, a significant error was my nonchalance. I realized that I didn't pay enough attention to the little things that mattered – like understanding her interests, remembering things she liked, or coming up with thoughtful gift ideas. This lack of attentiveness eventually took its toll on the relationship. It's something I've promised myself never to repeat. I've learned that the small things can mean a lot in a relationship, and being attentive to your partner's likes and dislikes is crucial.  
  
So, I'm curious to hear from this community: What's a mistake you've made in your dating life that you now strive to avoid? It could be anything from communication mishaps to not respecting boundaries. I believe we can all learn from each other's experiences and grow together as better partners.

I reduced my YouTube subscriptions from 500+ to 73. I didn't expect how it would make me feel.,"I used to have around 500 YouTube channel subscriptions ranging from topics like movies, music, and memes. A few seconds ago, I reduced it to exactly 73 channels only (and it'll probably go lower as time goes on). I've been feeling like my online accounts do not reflect me anymore, so I've been unfriending/unfollowing people left and right.

It was a very menial task, but I wasn't prepared for how I would feel before unsubscribing to some of these channels. I clicked the unsubscribe button faster on some, but for others, I took a longer look at. It's weird how I remember exactly how these online people used to make me feel.

One was for CS:GO tips and tricks, the other one was for graphic design. Things like that.

Don't get me wrong, I do not remember every single one of them. Some made me go, ""Who the fuck are you?"" and ""Why would I even watch you?"".

"Movie/Show/Novel Recommendations, anyone?","Alrighty, so, I have seriously been living under a rock for a while when it comes to this.
So I would love some good TV Show/Movie/Novel Recommendations for each type/category/genre/theme listed below:

(1) Thriller/Action/Adventure wherein protagonist intentionally/unintentionally forms a ragtag group to fulfill their mission and they all later begrudgingly start to respect and love each other and become a sort of found family. Should have some elements of teamwork and friendship.

(2) Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk/Futurist/Transhumanist with themes of existentialism, philosophy, maybe AI - ""what makes a human, a human""
(I have heard Netflix's Altered Carbon is pretty good, can anyone share their thoughts on this?)

(3) Any thriller/mystery genre containing romance as well, between two competent people who initially butt heads with each other due to their differences in working style/approach/expertise but later come on to respect each other's differences and start developing affection and love for each other.
(Bonus points if one of them is a more extroverted, golden retriever, derpy, goofball type and the other one is more stoic, silent, with a sharp wit.)
(Male x Female ; Male x Male ; Female x Female, all pairings are welcome, so don't hold back on that account!)

(4) Anything about uncovering legal/financial fraud, featuring a protagonist who is an anti-hero whistleblower.

Weirdest Dream I’ve Ever Had,"I suddenly “awoke” in a circular room. I was standing in the middle of it, fully aware, but no recollection of how I got there. There was an iPad on a podium against the wall, and I knew I had to go up to it. On the screen was only a “start” button, so I pressed it. Two columns came up, left side green, right side red. It looked kind of like a slot machine, where the columns can scroll. The green side started scrolling through a bunch of random sentences, super fast. I realized these sentences were describing good things I’ve done in my life. Millions and millions were counted and the “total” above the column was getting higher and higher, until it suddenly stopped, and the final score froze above the column. Then the red side began. 

Millions and millions of things I’ve done wrong in my life. The number above the red column was climbing and rapidly getting closer to the number on the green side. Then it surpassed it, scrolled a little longer, and finally stopped. The screen then went completely black. I felt HORROR. I felt DREAD. I knew what this meant. Then, something quietly faded in on the screen. It said, “You have been sentenced to Hell”. 

Then the screen went dark again. I waited in silence for whatever was to happen next, but then a button popped up on the screen: “Would you like to try again?”
“Yes,” I thought, “It’s gotta be a miss-count. There’s no way I’ve been more bad than good in my life.” I pressed “yes” and waited for the columns to appear again to re-count my life.

Finally get to love BTS all over again😭🥹,"I started to listening to kpop in 2015 and was a fan of BTS music. Spring day hit something in my heart; I really liked rap monster back then for some reason. Haha, but during this time, I also really like GOT7, Jay park, DAY6, listening to kpop here and there. I wasn’t a full on stan tbh! But just enjoyed the tunes. I remember when BTS army blew up into this big thing, I honestly didn’t really understand the fandom, so I kind of pulled back (no hate just was too much for me at the time!). Anyways, now that some of the BTS members debut their solo albums, it’s like I get to love BTS all over again, but at a slow comfortable pace? Like now taking time to actually learn about each member😭😭😭 and I say, I get it now!!! I see what you see army!!!!!!!!!!!! Jungkook, Jimin, V!!!!! It’s like a full circle moment! I hope one day to see them live😭I think I’d die!!!!! I started watching their YouTube channel and hehehehe each member is oh so cute ^_^",0,1704513711.0,t3_18zqwkc

"I’m tired of live action remakes, what we need is animated remakes","I and many others are, of course, tired of remakes of animated or drawn movies and series being turned into live-action remakes. Scott managed to get it right, like Scott Pilgrim and the criminally underrated Speed Racer movie, but overall in the current time, they end up as mediocre, lackluster, and are often just plain awful.

Animation is, as a whole, far more flexible of a genre than traditional film and allows for greater expressions of creativity. Films meant to be animated often are done well because of the medium of animation itself; changing it to live action creates far more restraints and ends up being overall a bad move most of the time.

But on the other hand, what I would love to see are more animated adaptations of books and live-action movies. When it comes to books, I feel as though Percy Jackson is the quintessential example of what I am talking about; hell, it is practically a shonen story already.

I have far too many examples, so I just made a list of pieces of media that I feel should have been animated or that I desperately want to have animated movie renditions:

- D&D Honor among thieves

- Literally all Kingsman movies

- Hunger Games

- Fantastic Beasts

- Maus (the comic)",0,1704506406.0,t3_18zof8h

"""Well, well, well. How the turntables.""","For the past few months, when my seldom-visiting cousin is in town, we play Pickleball every evening. After nearly a month since our last match, today we had two. The first one was fairly straightforward; I won 11-3. Seeking redemption, she proposed another game, to which I agreed. 

The second match began, and I struggled with my serves. Anyone who is familiar with the basics of Pickleball knows that you only score or get a point when the same is done after your chance of serve. The game went on, and the score stood at 4-0 in her favour. Feeling dejected but determined, I continued playing. Eventually, the score reached game point at 10-0 in her favour, leaving me disappointed in myself for not having scored a single point while she was just one (1) point away from winning. 

Now, this is where it gets interesting. I somehow managed to score after my serve, making the score 1-10. At this point, I was relieved that it wasn't going to be a plain shutout. Here onwards, the momentum shifted and how, as I soon found the score standing at 5-10 in my favour. A ray of hope sparked in me. Remarkably, I managed to tie the score at 10-10. Now, this is when I realised how disappointing it would be to lose at this stage.

After a tiring series of dueces and advantage point rounds, which seemed to last an eternity and almost making us reach a point of calling it a day, I managed to secure the final point and attained victory!!!

It was one of those situations that leave you feeling that the universe conspired to make things happen for you. Managing to take the score from 0-10, which is an inch away from losing, to 17-16: a bonafide comeback! It was one of the best things to have happened to my self-esteem in a while, so I had to document it somewhere. The high is going to last for a good amount of time.",0,1704484471.0,t3_18zfu6i

Setting boundaries isn’t always straightforward.,"It seems easy enough to set boundaries, sitting in the safety of a therapist’s office or from the comfort of my own bed. But what I’ve realized through life experiences is that boundaries are so much more complicated than simply stating “that is/isn’t an acceptable behavior to engage in.” 

Almost every time I’ve set a boundary, I’ve had to make a trade-off. Maybe I don’t hear about family drama that doesn’t involve me, but now I also leave my sister unsupported. Maybe I don’t let my mom trauma dump on me, but now I also stay awake at night worrying about her attempting to end her life again. Maybe I tell my friend I won’t take her engagement photos if she cancels one more time, but now we’ve lost some trust and ability to communicate.

Some days ago a cousin of my mom (honestly to me he's my uncle) came over to our house and stayed some days here. I barely know him and let alone talk to him, but honestly I didn't even mind that he stayed in the house.

But one thing I do know of him is that he had a pretty traumatic childhood. Why? Sometimes I heard when he talked with my mom, and I couldn't help but listen a bit. For what I could heard, his parents both died when he was a kid and he was sent to an orphanage, where he stayed a long time. He has pretty bad memories from that place. He has lived all of his life alone too. He barely has any family, let alone talk to them. And actually, it was even my mother who reached out and invited him to the house.

One day, he asked my mom if she didn't hear him crying during the night. My mom said no. He said he asked this because some people he knew said that sometimes, they'll hear him cry in his sleep. At this point I feel so bad about him.

ANNND, I couldn't help but-- I thought that was a good idea for a character. LET ME EXPLAIN. You see, I'm writing a novel, and one of my characters I've created for it is a bit (?) alike to him.

Could you please provide brand names, key words to search, or anything else helpful? Thanks so much in advance!",0,1705980693.0,t3_19dexdt
