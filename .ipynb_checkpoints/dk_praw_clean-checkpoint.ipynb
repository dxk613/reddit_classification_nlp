Only thing I don\\'t is start and some middle parts. If anyone\\'s wanna rea here it is-\\n\\n24-01-2024\\nIt\\'s about a robbery and a big robbery. I don\\'t know any people at all and i don\\'t know where it started. There was a plan and we went ahead then we have to cross this border via rail so there was checkup inside some building. And also for robbery there was a lotta people involved and weirdly some dolls similiar looking ever at size smaller than my finger dolls.then we go ahead across border. Maybe we complete robbey and come back and while coming back there was this big bomb attached to the last bogey of train and rail track creating friction. Also before that we were all in a room where when I went to chel up luggage I saw those dolls in a small box I talked about, all in red dress. Also about that bomb is that we if we stop the train the bomb will touch the ground n we\\'ll all explode. and at last distance our train starts to stop idk why so we go to the bomb and pull it while the train is running to maontain the friction. The bomb starts to get red but I don\\'t remember what happens to the bomb. But I do remember that train stops and in the station and 3 of us (all boys) are across this big lake we have to swin and some people involved in robbery already crossed it. So I go first then those to also starts to swin and while swimming I get so sleepy and starts to sleep and drown. But after hearing their voices I wake up in the water and starts swimming again. After we reach other side of lake we had to go through checkup so we do in this big facility. I do remember sending our bag for checkup after reaching other side of lake. So after checkup we are in this room together at our station and one of the guy vomitss so badly that I dont take that well and starts to sing and spit in basin (also i remember there was a basin for every guy and aside of every locker). The thing is I clearly remember what i sing \"ohh motha fuckar ohhhh motha fuckar and when I spit in dream I also spit in real life lmao. So I feel liquid n woke up.

As I got older I didn’t let my anxiety and fears of illness really bother me as much until I was about 18 years old. I started having severe panic attacks and since then I’ve just been a nervous wreck.\\n\\nI’m 30 now, and for the last 8-10 years I’ve convinced myself of having so many different types of illnesses… I’m in so much medical debt from going to the ER every time I think something is wrong (I stopped doing this though) and I’m always going to the doctor and seeing different specialists because for some reason I’m always having symptoms of something.\\n\\nAnyways, recently my big worries have been colon cancer and bladder cancer. Colon cancer because I’ve always had issues with regular bowel movements, I’m constipated a lot of the time. On top of that I have rectal pain and abdominal cramps all the time, although I’m not sure if the abdominal pain is do to my woman parts?? That’s still up for debate. And then bladder cancer is a worry because I’ve been having bad urethral pain on and off for months.\\n\\nI guess I’m just curious what other people worry about, with google being so accessible it’s so common for me to meet others who deal with similar worries.

       "  'selftext': 'Has anyone quit anything (not necessarily a job) because they were too scared, or not cut out for something, even though they still kind of want to do the said thing? I’m feeling dejected, silly, and stupid all at the same time, and I am wondering if anyone has felt something similar. \\n\\nMy husband and I have skied five times; we took a beginner lesson last year. We started out at a very small, rural resort. We have only skied the bunny hill and the one green trail that they offer. Last Sunday we checked out a different, larger resort.  We are not comfortable with blue runs yet; we had all intentions to stick to the different green trails.\\n\\nWe started out at their smallest green trail, which was great! Let me preface this by saying that getting off the chair lift scares me! I have yet to master getting off a chair lift. The chair lift for this first trail was relatively easy; I fell the first time, but then got the hang of it on the second go around. We got in a few runs and had a great morning. \\n\\nThen we went to another green slope. Here\\'s where the fun stopped... The slope while getting off the chair lift was super steep. I saw it two seconds before getting off and said, \"Oh no...\" My husband and I both wiped out. I came down hard and I\\'m certain I bruised, maybe even fractured my tailbone. So then, in a lot of pain and wiping the tears away, we then had to try to ski down that slope, which felt a lot more like a blue, even black, in our books. We managed the first half of the slope, but then it evened out before dropping off to, what felt like to us, a cliff! I ended up taking my skis off and walked down. My husband managed to get down, but he said he was not comfortable at all. \\n\\nIt definitely put a damper on our day. We did get some more runs in down the first green trail, but I was so fearful after our earlier experience that the fun was gone. \\n\\nI feel like I could ski the smallest slope 150 times, and I’d still be too scared to go on that other chair lift and “green” trail. One fall off that particular chair lift the wrong way, and I could be seriously be injured. How are people supposed to progress and advance??? \\n\\nWhy do chair lifts have to be the way they are? Why can’t all ski lifts be a j-bar or a t-bar? Why can’t chair lifts stop completely for a second or two, for you to ski off a flat section?  (Skiers, please be nice. I’m frustrated, and mostly just speaking hyperbolically at this point.) \\n\\nI am wondering if the anxiety, being fearful of the chair lift, being scared of injuries, and dealing with the injuries themselves is even worth it anymore. By the time I’m at the bottom of a run, I’m thinking, ‘Oh no, time to face the chair lift again.’ I’m seriously considering trying cross country skiing next year instead. I live in a cold, snowy area, and the whole point of trying skiing was to find more joy in the wintertime. \\n\\nI am so mad and upset at myself because I had these silly visions of getting better and better at skiing, taking ski vacations, etc. We had wanted to try a third ski resort, but now I don’t want to because I don’t know what the chair lift is like. I don’t want to be seen as a quitter. I feel like it’s one thing to put yourself out of your comfort zone (taking the ski lesson) but why should someone have to go through something that absolutely terrifies them? \\n\\nI had thought of just continuing to ski the bunny slope and the two greens we know for all time, but is it worth it? I’m still scared of the smaller chair lifts. \\n\\nHas anyone else gone through something remotely similar? I’d be surprised if a skier managed to come across this post. \\n\\nIf you made it to the end of this, thanks!

       "  'selftext': \"When I was a kid, I didn't really ''put effort into'' making friends because my family had a lot of REALLY close friends who had children that I basically grew up with. When I'm with these ''kids'' (we're adults now lol) that's the only time I get this sense of family and belonging. It feels like the connection that we have between one another is special. For better or worse, a chunk of us don't live in the same countries so we only get to do this 2-3 times a year.\\n\\nIn school, I was never part of friend groups because I felt like these people were trying to act ''cool'' for having a lot of friends. (What does that even mean?? 😃) I had individual friends but not a clique.\\n\\nIn university, I was markedly older than my peers and I really didn't feel like I had anything in common with them. I did make two close friends for life there but that's that.\\n\\nIn almost 10 years of work I have never made a single friend with whom I would hang out after hours. I'm very introverted at work even though I'm quite extroverted ''IRL''. Always a desk job, always with people significantly older than me, always with people who I did not feel like I can relate with. I had a girlfriend from work once but that's that. I have definitely started to work on this after I had a conversation about it with my mother - she was/is also like that - very very rarely clicks with the people she works with. I have put in some effort to be more present in the office even though she has SO MANY FRIENDS outside work. At the end of the day this one is probably on me.\\n\\nI think I am very good at 1 on 1 conversations. I believe I am an interesting person to talk to. I can go to a bar or social event alone and I will almost instantly find someone to talk to without being intruisive. Example: when I went to a corporate team building event in 2022. Over 200 people. I arrived around 6 in the evening and up until 6 in the morning I had long and meaningful conversations (probably an hour or so) with about 10 different people whom I hadn't met before. This begs the question - why didn't this lead to anything further? Why didn't I actually become friends with any of these people? \\n\\nI know that 99% of friend groups need to have a common environment where comradery can flourish. You basically can't pick random people off the street and ''create'' a friend group, there needs to be something to keep them together and in contact. \\n\\nI have (had) friend ''''''''groups''''''''' of 3-4-5 people but that doesn't give me the sense of belonging that I'm talking about.\\n\\nHere is what I have identified so far as my potential shortcomings:\\n\\n1. I'm passive. I think this is the biggest and most significant one. Be the change that you want to see in the world. I could organize stuff with people and not just wait for them to happen. The social things that I do have almost always been someone asking/inviting me to go somewhere/ do something, almost never initiated by me.\\n\\n2. Maybe I'm delusional? Maybe I'm not as interesting or likeable as I think I am? Maybe I dominate conversations too much? I definitely don't have the need to be liked by everyone so I don't suck up to people and I'm fine with someone not being my fan so idk about that... I don't think it's true but... maybe?\\n\\n3. I like having the attention on me in a way that the flow of the conversation is not interrupted. Maybe that's why I (think I) flourish in 1 on 1 conversations - people are not distracted. I have their undivided attention and there is no jumping from topic to topic the way that it often happens with group conversations. I like to be heard.\\n\\n4. My interests have almost always been ones that do not require other people. idk... cubing, true crime, chess, science and general knowledge stuff, etc. etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nI've started going to BJJ now and I hope that with consistency I could be able to make friends there and potentially insert myself somehow as I like a couple of the guys over there but who knows? I'm going to the office more often, I'm trying to organize more stuff with my (individual 😀) friends.\\n\\nIt's possible that I'm chasing flying pigs. I'm looking for a group of people to be part of my identity the way my childhood friends are most certainly a very important part of who I am as a person and that's simply unattainable.\\n\\nThoughts, criticism?\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Hi everyone, I hope you are having a great day. I’m a huge movie buff and I love watching all kinds of films, from classics to indie gems. But sometimes I feel like some movies don’t get the recognition or appreciation they deserve, either because they are overshadowed by more popular ones, or because they are misunderstood or misjudged by critics or audiences.\\nSo I wanted to ask you, what are some of the most underrated movies that you love? Movies that you think are brilliant, but not many people have seen or heard of, or movies that you think are unfairly criticized or overlooked. And why do you love them? What makes them special or unique to you?\\nI’ll start with a few of my favorites:\\nThe Fall (2006): This is a visually stunning and emotionally moving fantasy adventure film, directed by Tarsem Singh and starring Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru. It’s about a hospitalized stuntman who tells a fantastical story to a young girl, using the people and objects around him as inspiration. The story is shown in vivid colors and breathtaking locations, while the reality is shown in muted tones and bleak settings. The film explores the power of imagination, storytelling, and friendship, and it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I’ve ever seen. It’s a hidden gem that deserves more attention and praise.\\nThe Prestige (2006): This is a mind-blowing and twisty thriller, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. It’s about two rival magicians who compete to create the ultimate illusion, while sacrificing everything in their obsession. The film is full of surprises, secrets, and revelations, and it keeps you guessing until the very end. It’s a masterful and clever film that explores the themes of obsession, rivalry, sacrifice, and identity. It’s one of Nolan’s best films, in my opinion, and it’s often overlooked by his other more famous works.\\nThe Truman Show (1998): This is a brilliant and original comedy-drama, directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey. It’s about a man who discovers that his entire life is a reality TV show, and that everyone he knows is an actor. The film is a satire of the media, consumerism, and the human condition, and it raises some interesting questions about free will, reality, and identity. It’s also a showcase of Carrey’s dramatic range, as he portrays a man who goes from blissful ignorance to existential crisis. It’s a film that is both funny and poignant, and it’s one of my all-time favorites.\\nSo, what are some of the most underrated movies that you love? I’d love to hear your thoughts and recommendations.',\n",

I don't think much of it for a while, until the verse about the Cadillac and the graveyard come on and it grabs me like it never has before.

When I started working there during Covid, it had the gas prices around that time, but the windows were boarded up. So even though the gas pumps were on and there were cars in the parking lot, the place looked abandoned.\\n\\nThen last year in Fall, the boards were torn down, but the gas price was changed. Changed to $6.49 per Gallon for Normal, and $0.08 for Diesel. What the hell? Even weirder is that the parking lot had only about 2 cars and no customers. You’d think diesel trucks would jump on the opportunity. And then night would come, and they would become busy with a bunch of black cars filled with people speaking Spanish.\\n\\nFinally, last week, the prices of gas were returned to normal, but the black cars still show up at night. Seems they got legit air pumps for tires now, though. The people in the cars seem pissed at the workers, and they just yell at them in Spanish.\\n\\nSo night shifts are very fun.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"I passed my driving exam and got my license 20 years ago, and then never drove again! Kind of strange, I know.\\n\\nPrimarily I've always had a fear of driving, traffic is scary. People are texting while driving and drifting out of their lane. There's a lot of road rage out there, and a lot of people who drive dangerously. \\n\\nAlso I could never afford a vehicle or car insurance anyways, but I'm sure I could have borrowed my parents' car from time to time if I wanted to, which I didn't.\\n\\nBut I bring this up because I'm going to try and get back into driving now, as scary as it still seems...it's very difficult to be a functional adult in this country (US) without being able to drive. I could Bike, but that's just as dangerous if not more dangerous that driving. Plus it gets to be 110 degrees here in Arizona, and biking in that heat doesn't sound fun.\\n\\nSo even though I can legally drive now, I definitely need a refresher on all the traffic rules/laws, and then I need to take small steps like driving around in an empty parking lot, and eventually getting a driver instructor (hopefully they are better than my first one, who was mean and made me lose any little confidence that I had at the time).\\n\\nIt's tough to get over a fear you've had for so long, but I think it could really be beneficial to my life. I wouldn't have to bug other people to try and get a lift somewhere any time I had an appointment or needed some groceries or whatever.\\n\\nSo I'm definitely *not* looking forward to it, but my therapist really wants me to, and my family really want me to drive. It's going to be frightening for sure, but I think I can do it. \\n\\nNot many people in their late 30s are trying driving for basically the first time!\\n\\nAny advice for a first time driver? I'm not going to be taking any big trips or anything, I'm going to be starting out slow and maybe driving to some nearby places 2 or 3 times a week as I get more comfortable behind the wheel.\",\n",

After years of just lurking on reddit, then uninstalling it to try and break free from the obsessive mindless scrolling, to now finally reinstall it, make my first post and feel like I have a purpose to be here.\\n\\nI would like to share so much of what is going on right now in my life, and I hope I will over the coming weeks, months, or even years. The feeling of real happiness about life comes way too seldom for me, and this time I\\'m aiming to take advantage of it for real.\\n\\nIt\\'s all quite paradoxical really, just a few days ago I decided to end my relationship with my girlfriend. It wasn\\'t due to any dramatic reasons, our cooperation in everyday life was quite solid. However I had more and more come to realise that we were quite different when it comes to \"what makes one tick\", to give a very short explanation.\\n\\nAnyway, the current feeling is freedom; freedom to do whatever I want, wherever I want. I want to change my ways from being a relatively shy person mostly hanging around at home (which also was the case in my previous relationship), to a person who is keen to experience new things with likeminded people. I want to be part of a community where I feel like people see me. Someday I want to find that someone who I can love and share my life with, have kids and be the best father I can possibly be.\\n\\nHowever, this is all just in my head at the moment. I\\'ve previously had many similar moments of sudden bursts of euphoria, and those times it all just stayed in my head until it cooled down and, ultimately, ended in me going back to my previous ways of living. This time I actually want to act upon these feelings I\\'m having, and enact some change in my life, and hopefully spread some positivity in the directions of others along the way.\\n\\nHas anyone else here had these kinds of \"aha\" moments and acted upon them? If so, please share how this journey looked for you, and any tips you have for me to actually break free this time, and live life to its fullest.',\n",

It\\'s summer here in Aus and I\\'m SERIOUSLY swarmed by mozzies every night when I try to sit outside on my wooden deck.\\n\\nThe deck is basically a large box made of wooden slabs, about 4 metres by 4 metres worth of floor space, and the box itself is about 2 metres high. So, when we go out onto the deck, we\\'re on TOP of that box. Under the box\\'s \"ceiling\" (which we stand on) is a dark space built on top of untreated dirt.

For context, I’m male and am backpacking outside of my own country. \\n\\nI was at an intersection in Auckland. I stood at the edge of the road, waiting for the crossing to turn green, as this lady passes me. She’s angrily shouting back at a guy who’s further down the street, following her. She’s very obviously furious at him for something, and is hurling things out at him as they’re passing this very public intersection.\\n\\nHe strides after her, returning just as much anger as she’s giving. I get the impression that they’re in a relationship. He catches her up and they’re now pretty close to one another. I watch her anger quickly turn to fear, and she starts to cry and reach to call someone on her phone. \\n\\nI’m trying to judge whether he looks like he is going to turn their argument physical, and I’m getting a bit nervous that I’m not safe either. My crossing turns Green and starts beeping whilst I’m stood there watching him continue to close in on her, and she starts to cower and continues calling someone. \\n\\nI don’t even know who you would think to call in that moment, and I don’t have to know because of the privileged position of being a guy, and that makes me feel embarrassed and isolated. It makes me feel compliant to a horrendous problem rather than an ally to its victims and feeling like I’m not doing my part to combat the harmful actions of another man. \\n\\nI keep watching, frozen with complete indecisiveness about what to do in this moment. His proximity to the girl starts to change - his face calms, he hugs her, and tries to stop her crying. \\n\\nI’m standing there processing what’s just gone on. I think about leaving and I feel like I’ve narrowly missed a scenario where I’d have had to choose whether to intervene. As I turn to leave, I finally make eye contact with the girl. We looked at each other for a moment and she’s still crying, but her face quickly turns from distraught to furious. \\n\\nShe breaks free from the guy and strides towards me as she screams “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT”. My concern for her immediately switches to fear, and I sprinted across the crossing and kept running back towards my hostel.  I’m feeling scared and anxious that a car is about to scream down the road after me. \\n\\nI got back to the hostel and couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d just done, and what would have happened if he had turned to violence instead of ‘just’ emotionally manipulating her. I still felt horrendous for the lady being in that situation, but simultaneously really confused as to why someone in that situation would react in that way. I was trying to be someone who acts as an ally, rather than continuing on and being ignorant to this risk that another man would act physically against their partner. \\n\\nI don’t want to offend or exclude anyone with this - I know that physical and emotional harm can go both ways. Could just use some advice on how to deal with that kind of situation better in the future.',\n",

On the day we met in particular, it was nap time at the program, and our sleeping mats were next to each other.\\n\\n“What’s your name?” She whispered.\\n\\n“My name is Yvette!”\\n\\n“Evie?”\\n\\n“No, *Yvette*,” I corrected. She proceeded to tell me that her name was Kayla - we clicked and became best friends immediately, and still are to this day almost 18 years later.\\n\\nBecause she couldn’t pronounce her T’s correctly, Kayla just called me Evie and I rolled with it. Since then, majority of my close friends and buddies call me Evie instead of Yvette. Even though we’re full-grown adults now, every single time we see each other or talk on the phone, the conversation between me and Kayla always starts out as: “Hi, Evie!” and “Hey, Kaylabug!”\\n\\nSo, people of Reddit, what is your nickname? How did you get it? Do you think it suits you more than your original given name? Tell me the origin stories below!',\n",

Always a constant pullback that makes a person speculate herself over and over due to peer pressure, societal rules, community guidelines, social acceptance with persistent comments from people they encounter everyday either in real life or through social media. Questioning. Criticizing. Conjecturing. Comparing every action. Every movement. Every moment. With judgmental opinions. With biased decisions. With disrespect. With cruelty.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIt is not easy. Not for anyone. Not for me. Not for you. There is no measurement. Maybe the times I am going through are “rougher” than yours. It doesn’t necessarily mean your situation is easy.

That you are also an “able” person with equal willpower. The road is not going to be smooth. It is not going to be easy. You might face difficulties that no one has ever faced. Disrespectful comments. That you are not worthy. You might even be used. Might be disregarded. This world is a vicious place. And for that I can only say this. You deserve all the happiness in the world. All the respect in the world. All the positivity in the world. Just for being able to do what you are doing. Just for enduring this callousness. Just for being who you are. And for that, I write this to you. A tribute. An accolade. For being a part of this world. For being able to survive. For your energy. For your existence. For your presence. For you. For all of what is you. I whole heartedly thank you for being yourself. You. Are. Awesome.',\n",

It occured to me how people can just transform their lives for the better by a huge margin with just these few changes to their lifestyle. This is something I started doing by observing my parents and many other people in my family. And after I implemented this into my Life, it actually started making a phenomenal difference.\\n\\nMaybe what lies ahead in the day is not completely in my control, but it kinda feels like I\\'m coming in fully prepared mentally and physically into the day and giving my best, and that definitely feels like a great start! Hell, that\\'s actually a wonderful start. Worst case, I at least feel alive to Life rather than drowsy and moody. It does really feel like it\\'s those simple changes that I feel the need to start with to make things better for myself. I think that these extra efforts in the morning can be the decider between a beautiful and long day. Don\\'t you guys think so too?\\n\\nI love this quote \"Life is simple.

About 1/3rd of the building was used to house a museum dedicated to local history, which in this case meant the history of the American railyards, the rooms were clean enough to qualify for being used as a surgical theater, the furnishings were high quality, and I actually got a good night's sleep in a hotel.

       "  'selftext': 'Apologies for the long post! I know this may be a little out of place but…\\nContext: Hello! I’m currently getting my BA in Psychology and I am a first generation college student (so most of the help I have received in terms of what in the world I am doing with myself has come from google, the occasional conversation with professors, and reddit). I am supposed to be graduating this time next year and have been building up a “nice” transcript/GPA in hopes of continuing on to get my masters.\\nHere’s where I need help/advice. I want to be a child psychologist with education/experience if not certification in the world of play therapy. I took part in a practicum recently that unveiled my love for working with children and a desire to dedicate myself to learning play therapy practices in specific. I have some interest in adolescents as well but I have almost completely leaned away from working exclusively with adults since my freshman year. I decided on a masters because while I want to publish things in the future (maybe a book or two who knows nothing too fancy)… I do not think a PhD or the “title of being a doctor” is necessary for me to do so. Which is the impression I was under before… to be respected I “must” pursue the highest education possible.\\nAnyways, would the best route be to pursue a masters program focused on mental health counseling but specify my concentration in child development/child psychology? Is clinical psychology a better approach for this? Are there any universities in particular with programs that would best fit my situation? Any bits of knowledge or concepts I do not seem to fully understand?\\nI have a list of some schools I am interested in that have been accredited by the APA and some if not most also being accredited by the play therapy association. Yes, I have looked into them and the many professors behind the various programs… but everything feels so much more overwhelming than it probably is. I am starting to freak myself out, convince myself that I do not know what I am doing, and overall I have been stuck in a loop for a few months of googling the same questions over and over only to find the same answers that send me back into the loop again. I know that social work and marriage counseling are things I would like to stay away from if at all possible.\\nAgain, I’m sorry for the blurb, I truly do not know what else to do except ask for help.

       "  'selftext': \"Ive always kind of known, since I was a 15-16 year old teenager, that I am apparently abrasive to some people.  I dont quite know what it is, because it's not often you have an opportunity to ask people why they dont like you.  Im assuming it's actually not how I am saying something, but actually what I am saying in most instances.  \\n  \\n  Im pretty quick witted and I love poking fun at things, and I think that I raise people's guard quickly, because I dont really act any differently towards strangers as I do with my friends.  I dont have a guard until people give me a reason for me to have one, so I basically treat people the same.  I realize isnt necessarily the best approach, but I dont really enjoy anyone's company that takes life too seriously.  So I feel like my personality tends to weed out people, that to me, are too uptight and rigid.  \\n  \\n  Abrasive is probably a the best word to describe me upon first meeting me, despite the fact that I dont have any ill-intent, ever.  If I have ill-intent in my words, that person, and anyone who hears it, would definitely know I were serious.  However, at any job or hobby (involving others) that ive ever had, after a certain amount of time, I seem to befriend every single person, regardless of gender, nationality, etc. etc..  I work in a restaurant with people from 16 to 56.  Most are in their 30s, but I get along with everyone.  The older folks, the younger folks, man or woman, doesnt matter they all will seek me out to just chat.  \\n  \\n  It's really great when you *gel* with everyone, but it can take me a while to win some people over.  Ive been there a year, and up until just a few months ago, one of your servers was a little standoffish towards me, but nowadays she busts my balls right back and we joke around like brother sister.  When you first meet me you may not like me, but I grow on you, because I think people realize I have good heart and intent (I hope), and that im someone you can confide in and seek advice from.  I think it's pretty clear by this post that im definitely opinionated, but im extremely flexible.  Ill occasionally make wild statements like 'X always happens when Y goes down', and im only partially serious and im usually being quite hyperbolic.  \\n  \\n  So I was kind of curious what everyone here thinks that *other people* think of them?  I love some good ol' fashioned introspection.  I also think it's important to be polite and kind when youre around others, despite what you might be going through, so I try to be fairly jovial and upbeat, pretty much all the time.  Granted, when you cant hold in anymore, everyone around you knows something is going on, which then prompts everyone to ask *'Are you ok?'*, since everyone is legitimately concerned.  How do you find yourself blending with your co-workers?  Your family, friends?  Is there anything about yourself that youre actively working on changing?  Id like to be less openly opinionated, at least in situations where people dont know me that well.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Back when I was in college, I met the most amazing, beautiful girl. \\n\\nWe hit it off super quickly. We weren\\'t even on the same course as each other. I did engineering, she did art, we met on the bus.\\nWe\\'d meet up for drinks and to hang out after college, I couldn\\'t get enough of her.\\n\\nLooking back, we were extremely flirtatious with each other, I just didn\\'t see it at the time. \\nI really liked her, but I was in a serious relationship with my first proper girlfriend at the time. She was also in a serious relationship but broke things off with him pretty early into our friendship. This might have been a sign for me to do the same, I just didn\\'t see it at the time.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t happy in my relationship, but I found it hard to break things off after being together for so many years. There was this one time when my (now ex) girlfriend was away for the weekend. Me and my friend got quite drunk at a party, stripped down to our underwear, and started fooling around in bed. I still remember the warm feel of her skin. I knew it was wrong. We both did. We didn\\'t sleep with each other, although we might as well have, as I\\'d still consider what we did as cheating.\\n\\nWe never spoke about what happened. I remember asking her if she wanted to talk about it, but she didn\\'t. \\n\\nThere was another time, a year or two later, where we were out drinking with friends. I had finally broken up with my ex at this point, and it was the first time we\\'d gone out properly since. \\nThe two of us decided to split off from the group to go into a different bar for a few drinks. I was extremely drunk, but I can remember us making out like there was no tomorrow. \\nI remember waking up the next day vaguely remembering what happened. As I sobered up and my memories were coming back, I started to remember the night more clearly. I messaged her something along the lines of \"omg did we kiss last night??\". She didn\\'t want to talk about it. She was drunk and wasn\\'t in control.\\nI remember messaging my best friend later on that day to tell him what had happened. I was still excited that something had finally happened, even if she didn\\'t want to talk about it.\\nMy friend told me that she had kissed another one of the boys that night, too. I felt gutted. But we were both single, she has every right to kiss whoever she wants to.\\n\\nThings slowly went back to normal. If she didn\\'t want to talk to me about these things, I wasn\\'t going to pursue.\\n\\nA few months later, she sent me a Snapchat while she was on a night out. She sent a video of her saying something. All I can remember is that she was crying.\\nI was over a friend\\'s house at the time, and for some reason, I decided to watch the video with my phone muted. \\nI messaged her, apologising that I couldn\\'t hear her. I asked her if she was OK and if she wanted to talk. The next day, she got back to me, and she didn\\'t want to talk about it.\\n\\nAfter a few years of college, she went to university and met a new friend group, got a new boyfriend, etc. They didn\\'t last long.\\n\\n\\nAs the years went by, we slowly grew apart, until eventually we stopped contact completely. \\n\\nI\\'m in a new relationship now. 7 years down the line, and I\\'m feeling the same way as I did before, unsatisfied. For years, I\\'d think of my old friend every single day, missing them and wondering what they\\'re up to. I struggle in this relationship and with previous ones, constantly comparing girls with her. I know I shouldn\\'t, and I feel deeply guilty about it.\\n\\nI\\'ve recently stopped smoking weed after several years of addiction. \\nAlthough I don\\'t think about her as much anymore, I\\'ve recently started having dreams again. I\\'ve had a few dreams about her now. Last night was the most vivid one so far. I dreamt that we had met up with each other, along with a few other college friends. We ended up having a deep conversation about what\\'s happened to us over the years and why I haven\\'t reached out to her. This resulted in me finally leaving my current girlfriend and giving things a shot with her instead. \\n\\nThere\\'s been a few times when I\\'ve wanted to message her to ask if she wants to meet up. I feel like I\\'ve matured a lot over the years (I\\'m now 29), so maybe she\\'d be happy to talk things through with me now? \\nShe hasn\\'t been on social media for a few years now. Every time I\\'ve looked for her, she\\'s never there. \\nI haven\\'t heard anything about her in years, from anyone. I bet she\\'s travelling the world, doing amazing things. \\nI know things would never work out between us, I doubt I\\'ll even see her ever again. I just wish I could have the chance to talk to her one last time. I have so many unanswered questions.\\n\\nMan, I miss her.',\n",

Although my \"classmates\" are wonderful, the teacher is awesome and I never had a \"sport\" group like that growing up, I always feel exhausted and progress far slower than my mates (sometimes I even got home crying because I feel so weak). Now they are preparing for a competition, and this means one more class on Saturdays. If I don\\'t sign up for the competition, I know that the teacher would be more focused on the people training for that, so I feel I would be paying for basically being on my own...\\n\\nI could become stronger and try to catch up with the others by going to the gym but I don\\'t really have the energy and time during the week...\\n\\nIf I decide to try for the competition, I fear that would be a major trigger for my anxiety + pausing my riding classes, which lately have been much more beneficial to my mental health than aerials...\\n\\nI feel like this is the point where I have to choose one of those things, considering that I cannot economically do both.\\n\\nI know that ultimately I have to find the answer within me, but I am just curious to know what other people might do in my place, or if somebody at their point in life faced a similar decision :)',\n",

A couple of my husband\\'s friends are going to help us in cleaning the house, doing touch up yard work, and moving him over here.  So, it all turned out well.  I think it will be emotional for him to leave that house, but we\\'ll deal with that when we get to it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFunny note - we called my brother afterwards to tell him that it was all taken care of.  I talked to my niece who usually stayed in my bedroom when my brother and family came to visit.  She stayed in my old room, which looked the same as it did when I graduated high school.  She\\'s 10 now, but asked what\\'s going to happen to a poster I had up in the room.  It was a bare-chested model in the surf with the headline, \"A hard man is good to find\".

She didn\\'t want any details about dad\\'s move, just wanted to know what was going to happen with my poster.  she said it made her feel safe, and I commented that it made me feel something too, which is why I had it up.  She responded as if I had just said something really gross and said quietly, \"OOh.  You\\'re talking about sex, right?\"  guess at 10, she still thinks it and boys are gross, though that didn\\'t stop her from inquiring about the poster.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for the advice and comments.  they were a great help in calming me down and helping to figure out what to do.',\n",

Reading things back to myself I often wouldn\\'t catch these things. \\n\\nIs this just age catching up to me? I don\\'t have trouble with the actual typing. I type easily and probably about 60-70 wpm. I don\\'t have problem reading, so it\\'s probably not any type of dyslexia. My memory has been really bad, like a brain fog at times, which could be related in some way. It\\'s also not constant. I haven\\'t seen any errors in this post, but I\\'m also not checking. \\n\\nI\\'m just not sure what to think, but it really bothers me sometimes.

The snow/ winter is not my friend. A couple years ago after a snow storm a tree fell on and totalled my car in the middle of the night. I've crashed a different car into a different tree while driving in the snow. (Rear wheel drive, plus young and dumb) that car was also totaled. I've also gotten stuck in the snow about 4 times and my dad had to get the tractor to pull me out of the ditch. Basically, I shouldn't drive in the snow. I finally have a car that is meant to be in the snow but I'm too terrified to drive it and risk crashing our only car. Employers don't consider snow as an excuse to call out unless it's really bad. Which just adds to the stress. They offered to get me an Uber one time to come to work and I had to send pictures of all the cars stuck in the ice rink that was my apartment buildings parking lot. I had to tell them that the Uber wouldn't make it out. I'm trying to bake cookies as a distraction but it's snowing here and my shoulders are so tense.\",\n",

In the end, humanity, which hasn\\'t left but has colonized all of the Sol system, is forced to take drastic measures to ensure the encroaching danger is snuffed out.\\n\\nThe two survivors from that book have made it to a new planet called Hope in a one-way shot aboard a cryogenics-equipped ship in the sequel. Now, almost a thousand Earth-years later, the ship they rode in on is revered as sacred, and humanity, birthed from embryos aboard the ship, is thriving in a hybrid human-alien society with the Zmite. Something is lurking in the skies above though, and when a mysterious ship crash lands on Hope (this is the first time other aliens, besides humans, have visited the planet), the slumbering secrets of the ancient human ship begin to unfurl. \\n\\nI plan on making this a series, with epic space battles, romance, action, mysteries, and suspense. A space opera, if you will. There is a galactic federation controlled by a deep state known as the Invilave that knows of humanity\\'s sacrifice, and a confederated government known as the Outer Allied Worlds, who does not. The tension between them plays an integral part to the story as the horrors from the first book begin to rear their ugly heads again, threatening the entire galaxy. I plan on calling this series \"The Andromeda Crisis\".\\n\\nWhat are your WIPs, series\\', or favorite stories you\\'ve written? I love talking writing with people and would love to hear yours.

I’m always saying “nice outfit!” or “I like your scarf” to people I pass, men as well as women. I fear the male lack of compliments extends to a lack of other simple friendly gestures women pass between each other all the time—an arm on the shoulder, sitting while slightly touching each other, a hug that lasts longer than 2 seconds. I don’t see men give these to each other. We live in a social climate of intense loneliness, and I feel like the gestures my friends and I share are the antidote. I’m not sure men are getting enough of the antidote. Are you guys ok? I’m honestly guessing no. Tell me something about yourself or post a picture and I’ll give you a genuine compliment!',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'What is the purpose of life? Who am I meant to be? Everyone lives a different life, has different experiences. Some have it hard, and some start better. But we must all admit that no one\\'s life is perfect. No one in this world has never felt sadness. Sometimes I think how we clueless humans were just put on Earth some day. How? We do not know. A higher power? We evolved? Or something else we haven\\'t even thought of. In all these years, we invented things. They had all advantages but also disadvantages. Was life maybe better when we were just surviving in the wild? When there weren\\'t apps that took you to mindless scrolling, disconnecting from life. When there weren\\'t cars to cause accidents. When there weren\\'t beauty standards, or maybe there were. Because if you look closely into history, you see that we all needed to fit a standard, that changed after a while though. Now we are meant to fit beauty standards, never be sad, and enjoy life. But it is hard to stay positive.\\n\\nI can\\'t say that, though; I actually have a good life. But still I\\'m sad most times?\\n\\nI\\'m a bit scared. Scared of the bad people in this world. There are bad people; you can\\'t help but admit how humans can be so selfish. I don\\'t even get how conflicts start. Even the Roman empire had conflicts. They wanted to feel pride, accomplish something, selfish. Because in every conflict, there are innocent people getting hurt. But accomplishment is a big thing for humans. If you do not strive for something, you kind of get lost in time. Like, for example, my brother, he\\'s pretty smart but doing badly in school. I always see him playing games; I see how proud he is he has got to another level. But I know deep down that he wants to do more. I also want to do more. But I can\\'t since I\\'m in middle school. But still, you could study harder, be healthier, show more kindness, try to make money, and so on. But I don\\'t because I find comfort in doing absolutely nothing. But should you get out of that comfort or not? Many people stay in their comfort zone their whole life. Because what if you get hurt?\\n\\nAnyway, let\\'s talk about a basic human\\'s life; we get put on this earth knowing nothing. Some face mental challenges or sickness, which is so unfair. We learn through school, and for younger people, even social media. Some graduate, some can\\'t get jobs. We try our best to be happy in this world. Personally, I feel better being surrounded by love. My parents, I do not even know what I would do without them. If they faced challenges, I wouldn\\'t understand why a higher power would do that if it existed.\\n\\nBut not many people experience love. Grown up in a challenging household or never made friends. Some people are alone on Christmas. I think about that a lot. I told my parents when I\\'m older, I\\'m inviting a lonely person in my home for Christmas. Because personally, I think Christmas is about love, not giving trendy gifts from social media. My mom told me I shouldn\\'t do that. I should be careful because there are dangerous people out there. And that\\'s true. But not all, right? Right? Some maybe just made mistakes and are being neglected and don\\'t get love. But maybe some deserved it because some young person getting assaulted does not deserve that. Anyone really can be assaulted, that\\'s what I hate most about humans. They put people in a group \"men,\" \"women,\" \"a race,\"... . That\\'s actually so wrong to say that one WHOLE group of people are the same as some people in that group. I hate that people stereotype. I hate that people hate or gossip, cause admit people thrive on bringing someone down.\\n\\nWhy can\\'t we live in a safe world? A world where everyone can help each other, be kind, not get hurt... Maybe on a different planet? In this whole universe full of mysteries (like many mysteries that we can\\'t solve and I think of in a shower). But maybe that\\'s not possible because everything that lives isn\\'t always kind. Like animals, the circle of life. Maybe it just isn\\'t scientifically possible.\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about the internet. I don\\'t know why it was designed. Maybe to put people out of their miseries? To make them forget what a challenging world they live in. Does anyone also get that kick of realization after finishing a movie or series or even books? Now there isn\\'t just that; you have people who cook, talk, and humans connect, which actually is a good thing, but not always. You know what I also don\\'t get? Famous people. People worship them. Why? They are also just humans? They also have feelings, also live.\\n\\nDoes anyone also look back on their photos once a month? And cry of sadness or happiness? Looking back on happy memories. But I don\\'t actually know if I was happy then. No one knows one\\'s true feelings if they just put a smile on their face because the person behind the camera said \"smile.\" You never know someone truly or you do not know for sure you can trust them because sadly there are bad people in this world.\\n\\nLet\\'s take it back from the beginning. What IS the purpose of life? Because we\\'re clueless humans, even the smartest people do not know. You can say you\\'re wise but do you TRULY know? I will say my theory. I know that we were put on this world, I see it as a path. All wobbly paths, but some even more challenging. As a child you learn more and more about the world. Many people are afraid of the world. So am I. But I think that the purpose of life is to try to be happy. Cause we only got 1 life. (I think) Loving humans or animals or something else, enjoying the small moments and even the bad ones, finding a purpose, working towards being the best version of yourself, connecting with people because there wasn\\'t one but multiple people put on this world. That\\'s my theory, but that may evolve as I get older.\\n\\nI do not know why I wrote this. Guess I think too much. Or want to be able to change the world. To not let people hate each other, connect with each other, to not let people feel so alone they harm their only life (I think) they have. I genuinely want everyone to be happy. But many people take advantage of kindness. So should I be selfish? Bring other people down to make me feel like I\\'m at the top? Be like any human being and just copy ? What if I get hurt of i just be myself?\\n\\nI do not know what life will throw my way. I do know that everyone has a different life, different beliefs, different hobbies/ things they like, different bodies, different races, different families, born in different times,... We should embrace our differentness. We should let people do their own thing. Focus on our own, help the people who have it hard. Because be honest, everyone wants to be happy, live their \"perfect\" life, but that is impossible. But for everyone, that\\'s different.\\n\\nLife is a wobbly path, but when you fall and get a wound, get up and keep going; wounds heal even if it takes long or doesn\\'t get the help or love it needs. I believe because there are so many people in this world everyone would find someone they truly love, even after many divorces. I do not know how to end this, but if anyone read this whole paragraph. Wow 😧',\n",

During the day I peeled and gave my brother 4-5 of them like the cartoon character did. It went like that for a few days and after that my brother started to do the same thing for me. We were playing Minecraft together at that time so any time one of us takes a break comes back with two clementines for each of us. I'm pretty sure we ate about 30-35 kg clementines during that month. \\n\\nSince than it became a gag, an inside joke between us.

       "  'selftext': 'I’ve recently decided that I want to become an emt, I’ve always shown interest in that field of work but never was directed to pursue it when I was coming out of high school, until now. Recently I was given an opportunity to move out of state, California specifically, for a completely different job field involving from what I’m currently working as, on becoming an assistant for someone in my dads company, I shown extreme interest towards the Job opportunity, mainly because i get a perfect excuse to move to California and to have a fresh start, but when he told me the amount of pay and hours I’ve would’ve gotten ( which was yawing to say the least), it wouldn’t have been possible to live “comfortably” with the pay and hours he was offering me, so I sadly declined.\\n\\nDays after I declined I got to thinking tho, if I was so open to moving out to California why not go for it? That’s when the logical/realistic side of me kicked in saying stuff like “oh Judas the cost of living out there is really high” “oh you’ll be homeless by the time you’ll get there” “oh with your Job skills you won’t be able to find work out there” all that adult stuff. After some deep thought I told myself if I wanted to move out there I gotta acquire job skills to able to get a job that pays more and has better hours. So after looking into possible career fields, I’ve landed on becoming an EMT. And before any EMTs come in here telling me that becoming an EMT doesn’t pay well and all of that, I know, I’m just really gravitated towards that field for a nice change of pace, besides it pays slightly better than my current warehouse job. And from everyone I told in there, they all said I should go for it, don’t stay here for any longer, make us proud. So I want to do it! Make them proud and Improve myself.\\n\\nThe application process for it has been is easy so far, the only thing I’ve been stuck on is studying for the TEAS exam. My main issue that comes from it is that I don’t know where to start, literally that’s the only thing stopping me. There’s no clear direction on what I should be studying for, what are the IMPORTANT things I need to know to able to pass the exam. I know theirs a science, math, English, reading portions in the exam but what exactly from each category I need to know, I haven’t been in high school for 3 years so all of that science and math stuff is probably down the drain in the black void of my mind. Hell, I technically passed high school with dumb luck due to the pandemic, I was supposed to fail junior year.\\n\\nOverall I just don’t want the possibility of me becoming an EMT crushed just because I’m mentally paralyzed on where to study for this exam. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please and thank you to all of you.',\n",

We get in an sit down and we are bit early.  They are playing ads, of course, but they are so loud it feels like it's almost impossible to ignore them and have a conversation.  Finally, it's showtime... or is it?

A lot of oil, butter, cold cuts, bread, chips, ice cream, etc.\\n\\nI never gave any of it thought. I knew it was not healthy, but like many things we like and dont want to give up, its easier to not think about the fact that I am actively making a choice to do damage to myself. Bad things happen to other people. \\n\\nBut then I started to realize that bad things happen to anyone. Someone close to me got a heart attack. I could feel my pulse getting higher after eating certain meals. It didnt feel healthy. Sometimes got heart palpitations after meals, mild, but still concerning to me since I even though I knew it didnt probably mean I would drop dead right there and then, what I ate was probably a main reason for them.\\n\\nI started to research what I should eat. I came to the conclusion that based on the current science we have, dropping all (I have occasional cheat days though, mostly only if I am out and eating with people) meat and dairy products and oils and added sugar from my diet was a good choice. This automatically meant dropping almost all processed foods because its nigh impossible to find any processed foods that do not have added oil in them. \\n\\nEating healthy isnt just about what to not eat but also what to eat. Getting all the necessary nutrients is a must, supplimenting is necessary in some cases, like with vitamin b12. I am looking and researching more stuff a bit day by day. I never ate fruits before. Went almost my entire life without eating almost any fruits. Maybe 5 fruits per year if even that. Now I love fruits. I buy some seasonal fresh vegetables or other vegetables that are always cheap. Others I buy frozen. Lentils, legumes, rice, potatoes, beans. Lately I have been eating rice and lentils with an asian influenced sauce with vegetables. Its quite cheap to eat food like this, cheaper than when I ate meat.\\n\\nI have to say its been very good for me, its interesting getting to try new foods.\\n\\nIts never too late to make better decisions.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"For those of you who don't know me (which is everyone, how fun is that?), I like to come on here the night before my birthday and think about the year before. It started when I was 17, friendless, and spent \\\\*way\\\\* too much time online. Although I only hop on reddit for r/succulents questions these days, I've kept up with my birthday night-before posts. I love them, in all of their sappiness. Feel free to laugh at 'em. I do too.\\n\\n[Last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/10c9gko/im_turning_20_in_90_minutes/), my life was quiet. Moving into 20, I wanted to work on that. I said I wanted to feel more secure in my friends. I wanted to be less tired. I said I wanted to stop focusing so much on who I wanted to be, and just be. Profound, I know. As I started my 20s, I wanted to trust and have fun and own mistakes and let it all happen. And I'm happy to say that I did. Not perfectly, of course. It was only my first 20-something year. But I finally have what I believe to be a positive life update. Finally.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThis year, a lot happened to me. It was all rooted in two major life events. Two might not sound like a lot, but it was a lot to me. This is my life and I am very biased and dramatic. Dangerous combination.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThe first event was my first-ever big-kid adult job! Well, an internship. It fell in my lap at the last minute because someone else accepted and then rejected it. If I met that someone I think I would be obligated to marry them, or donate a kidney. I am so very grateful.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThe organization was prestigious, and I've dreamed of working for them since I was a little kid (I am deathly afraid of writing out the name, my apologies). They're the kind of prestigious that attracts people from all over the world and so I got to meet people my age from aaaaall over the world. I made more friends than I ever have. Not tried and true friends per se, but fun friends. The kind that push you to have a good time, to be social. And I needed a good push. \\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nMy friends helped me get to know my hometown and state through tourists’ eyes, and I loved the way they saw it all. I went on spontaneous trips, hiked through torrential downpours, went to local festivals, and accidentally became a groupy for the shittiest garage band I’ve ever heard. I talked my way over an international border. I sang karaoke the night before our favorite dive bar closed, may she rest in peace. I compiled a truly kickass business-professional wardrobe. I saw space shit that blew my mind. I had the best summer of my life, and I’ll never forget it. And even though we’ll never all be together again, I eagerly look forward to what’s ahead. I know so many of these people will do great things. I know I’ll send them Christmas cards fifteen years from now, and tell my kids about our silly adventures when they ask. I’ll be proud to have known them, even if only for a little while. I’m so excited for more seasons of life like this one.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThe second major life event was my first-ever big-kid adult relationship! And my first bre@k up (censored to keep peace with the mods, much respect to you all homies). I will not be divulging the messy details to you. Partially because I don’t want to bore you or start crying right now. And I respect that there should be some boundaries between me and the internet. But mostly because I recently counted and found that I have written 42 pages about this boy in my journal. 42. That’s psychotic. That’s delusional. I need to be stopped! I’m feeling better now, and am extremely grateful for the experience. Both the rise and fall of it all. He was very pretty after all. Oops.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThis year I also became very close and comfortable with my school friends. They’re not new or anything, we’ve been together for three years now. But I love them and they love me. And I am so grateful for them and every agonizing hour we spend studying together. Every single one is made better by their company and laughter. I love my friends.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nWith all that to consider, here’s what I’m looking for in 21: More of this. More friends and laughter and living. More new experiences and travel and excitement and good books. And more contentedness regarding my bre@k up because, boy oh boy, that was \\\\*not\\\\* fun. I can finally properly relate to Taylor Swift songs, but God at what cost?\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nIn all seriousness, I just want to enjoy being young. I am tremendously excited to one day settle down and have a family. But it can wait. I want to have fun. I want to have stories to tell my kids and I want them to make me seem \\\\*way\\\\* cooler than my future spouse. I want to enjoy it all. After my teenage years, I’ve got a lot of catching up to do. But this was a good start.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nA very good start.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nAs always, thank you to my 5-20 dedicated readers who happened to be online right now. You’re the real MVPs here. Get home safe. I’ll see you next year.\\r\",\n",

I feel like every time \\'printers\\' comes up on Reddit it\\'s always \"Ink costs more than blood!\" \"My printer locked me out of printing because it\\'s out of blue!\" And i always feel the knee jerk reaction to raise a finger and say \"It sounds like you were ill informed about your purchase\" but it never gets a good reaction. And they\\'re right, basically all printers are a price gauging scheme in one way or another, but it is a varied market with lots of choices and things to consider. Back when I actually worked in retail, finding someone lost in the printer aisle and taking the time to get them the product they needed was really heart warming. I had to consider market basket, add-ons and such, but I always pointed them toward a printer that was a good fit for what they needed.\\n\\nBuuut then the pandemic hit and we just had NOTHING for the longest time. It\\'s hard to talk to people and sell printers with no inventory. Eventually printers trickled in, but they were either bought up, or just not the right fit for a customer. It sucked ass, and eventually I left.\\n\\nIt was really nice to be able to help people with a niche issue. It was fun explaining the tech to people who were interested enough to hear about it. Not that i go into the nitty gritty, just \"Hey, Laser is better for highlighting because instead of liquid ink, it melts plastic onto paper, so no chance of smudges!\" little tidbits to seal the sell, y\\'know?\\n\\nI also used to repair and troubleshoot Drive Thru Headset equipment.

I actually found the topic to be really interesting, and I shit you not I can recite the whole paper and everything in detail, even though having only read it once. \\n\\nSo why is it that when reading something that I don't find interesting I have about 10 seconds of focus before my mind inevitably drifts off. I remember about 2 yrs ago when I was studying for a big test (equivalent to the SATs) I was reading a textbook on social studies, I had to constantly reread everything because my mind kept drifting off. I repeatedly found myself having read a whole chapter without remembering anything. \\n\\nWhen I was in high school this wasn't really an issue because I could just go to class and not have to read too much on my own. But now in college I have to study more after class, which means I'm barely passing the courses I don't like. \\n\\nNow, the big problem! The reason this is even an issue is because I've found that I don't really care about what I study. I knew going into engineering studies that it was only temporary because my big interest lies in psychology. Psych studies is very popular in my country so it might take a few years before I get accepted (I will keep retaking the entrance test), and therefore I needed to get my studies started somewhere, hence engineering.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo I would need some advice on how to better remember things when studying/reading something that I don't find interesting. No matter what I study in the future It's inevitable that there will be courses and things I will have to learn that I don't like, so I figured; might as well try different study methods and get better now. \\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice? \",\n",

Therefore, the word just wouldn’t be associated with an alternative meaning which has overtones of aggression and violence.\\n\\nIn that kind of advanced society, perhaps a synonym for ‘Arguement’ would be something majestic and positive like ‘Chorus, angelic harmony of ultimate divinity intertwined in the lyrics and lullabies of the most beautiful songs ever written’.',\n",

I would say this size range was basically almost always the standard size request for most of the blokes on site. \\n\\nNow lot of those guys have retired or left the the industry a d this next generation, Gen Z, are starting to come to work with us and its like sizes 7 to 9 UK seems to be the norm for these new guys.\\n\\nIt’s the same for safety overalls too we get way smaller size requests than the sizes we used to be ordering 10 to 13 years back. \\n\\nWe have like 20 somethings starting which look like high schoolers. \\n\\nHas Anyone else noticed this in their industry?\\n\\nMaybe our heights are levelling off and maybe peaked due to poor diets or something?',\n",

I never had the privilege of using connections as I got my job straight out of internship but I'm saying the job market now is tough. You will face tons of rejections even from dream companies and it can take quite a while to get a good entry-level position. That is why you have your parent’s networks or connections to help you get in, if you have them. I still want you to try getting in by yourself but the networks/connections should only be for after four months. It will give an impression you used every resource available. If you use those networks on the first day of job hunting, I will see you as privileged because it makes you seem dependent on your parents. Get help from your parents once you run out of options or are exhausted.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nYes you may get some flak and some toxic vibes, especially from the HR and some employees about how you got in (since some of these people never had connections in the first place) but remember that they would have done the same if they had those networks.

I could Bike, but that's just as dangerous if not more dangerous that driving. Plus it gets to be 110 degrees here in Arizona, and biking in that heat doesn't sound fun.\\n\\nSo even though I can legally drive now, I definitely need a refresher on all the traffic rules/laws, and then I need to take small steps like driving around in an empty parking lot, and eventually getting a driver instructor (hopefully they are better than my first one, who was mean and made me lose any little confidence that I had at the time).\\n\\nIt's tough to get over a fear you've had for so long, but I think it could really be beneficial to my life. I wouldn't have to bug other people to try and get a lift somewhere any time I had an appointment or needed some groceries or whatever.\\n\\nSo I'm definitely *not* looking forward to it, but my therapist really wants me to, and my family really want me to drive.

The feeling of real happiness about life comes way too seldom for me, and this time I\\'m aiming to take advantage of it for real.\\n\\nIt\\'s all quite paradoxical really, just a few days ago I decided to end my relationship with my girlfriend. It wasn\\'t due to any dramatic reasons, our cooperation in everyday life was quite solid. However I had more and more come to realise that we were quite different when it comes to \"what makes one tick\", to give a very short explanation.\\n\\nAnyway, the current feeling is freedom; freedom to do whatever I want, wherever I want. I want to change my ways from being a relatively shy person mostly hanging around at home (which also was the case in my previous relationship), to a person who is keen to experience new things with likeminded people. I want to be part of a community where I feel like people see me. Someday I want to find that someone who I can love and share my life with, have kids and be the best father I can possibly be.\\n\\nHowever, this is all just in my head at the moment. I\\'ve previously had many similar moments of sudden bursts of euphoria, and those times it all just stayed in my head until it cooled down and, ultimately, ended in me going back to my previous ways of living. This time I actually want to act upon these feelings I\\'m having, and enact some change in my life, and hopefully spread some positivity in the directions of others along the way.\\n\\nHas anyone else here had these kinds of \"aha\" moments and acted upon them?

When it comes to social settings: (particularly large events like weddings/engagement parties/work parties), many people drink; not because of dependancy or wanting to get drunk - but because it makes other people more interesting. \\n\\nI’ve seen a lot of shade on Reddit towards people who want to drink to enhance their fun.   \\nCriticisms like: “these types of people have a problem” or are “ alcoholics” or “sad” are thrown around so flippantly. \\n\\nThese criticisms makes me wonder if the people who criticise people for wanting a drink understand that some people just love enjoy the taste and because it’s a nice treat at the end of the week to get that boost/buzz.\\n\\nThe people criticising say things like \"I can have fun without drinking\"  implies that fun can just happen out of thin air regardless of our surroundings and doesn’t take into account the fact that many people are very socially awkward/ private or straight up BORING. \\n\\nSome people are naturally reserved because of their upbringing. Drinking makes them connect with a sillier part of themselves. One that is free and less inhibited. I think this is why many people are dependant on drinking at parties. It makes them more confident. \\n\\nThen there are others who are naturally bubbly, curious and extroverted. They don’t need alcohol to have fun. But it they are at an event where people don’t open up or are good conversationalists - that is when alcohol becomes a great staple.   \\n\\n\\nSometimes, people need booze to have fun (not because they are boring) but because other people are boring   \\n',\n",

It makes me feel compliant to a horrendous problem rather than an ally to its victims and feeling like I’m not doing my part to combat the harmful actions of another man. \\n\\nI keep watching, frozen with complete indecisiveness about what to do in this moment. His proximity to the girl starts to change - his face calms, he hugs her, and tries to stop her crying. \\n\\nI’m standing there processing what’s just gone on. I think about leaving and I feel like I’ve narrowly missed a scenario where I’d have had to choose whether to intervene. As I turn to leave, I finally make eye contact with the girl. We looked at each other for a moment and she’s still crying, but her face quickly turns from distraught to furious. \\n\\nShe breaks free from the guy and strides towards me as she screams “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT”. My concern for her immediately switches to fear, and I sprinted across the crossing and kept running back towards my hostel.  I’m feeling scared and anxious that a car is about to scream down the road after me. \\n\\nI got back to the hostel and couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d just done, and what would have happened if he had turned to violence instead of ‘just’ emotionally manipulating her. I still felt horrendous for the lady being in that situation, but simultaneously really confused as to why someone in that situation would react in that way. I was trying to be someone who acts as an ally, rather than continuing on and being ignorant to this risk that another man would act physically against their partner. \\n\\nI don’t want to offend or exclude anyone with this - I know that physical and emotional harm can go both ways. Could just use some advice on how to deal with that kind of situation better in the future.',\n",

Most importantly, you are humane. You. Are. Awesome.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhy all of a sudden? Why do I have to just add an adjective at the end of “You are”? Simple. People deserve appreciation. Any difficulty in the current era is constantly being problematized and asserted. Collations and contrasts have become a bane to a person’s measure of success. A burden adding to a person’s difficulties. A constant illness to her capabilities making her question herself. Is she doing it the right way? Does she look good while doing it? Is she sufficient? Has she accomplished enough? Is she qualified? Is she skilled? Is she emotionally strong? Is she talented? Is she willing? Is she sure? Is she… Is she… Is she…\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI am not talking about meager acceptance. That’s just cowardliness where you sit back and overthink your inability and thus end up stagnating at the same place. No. But the ladder to success is not merely filled with physical constraints these days but more of psychological and mental restrictions that the person is being inflicted upon at all times by the society and by herself. Always a constant pullback that makes a person speculate herself over and over due to peer pressure, societal rules, community guidelines, social acceptance with persistent comments from people they encounter everyday either in real life or through social media. Questioning. Criticizing. Conjecturing. Comparing every action. Every movement. Every moment. With judgmental opinions. With biased decisions. With disrespect. With cruelty.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIt is not easy. Not for anyone. Not for me. Not for you. There is no measurement. Maybe the times I am going through are “rougher” than yours. It doesn’t necessarily mean your situation is easy. But the fact that you are able to outperform and sustain in this competitive world with so much energy and courage is exactly what needs to be enlightened. That you are also an “able” person with equal willpower. The road is not going to be smooth. It is not going to be easy. You might face difficulties that no one has ever faced. Disrespectful comments. That you are not worthy. You might even be used. Might be disregarded. This world is a vicious place. And for that I can only say this. You deserve all the happiness in the world. All the respect in the world. All the positivity in the world. Just for being able to do what you are doing. Just for enduring this callousness. Just for being who you are. And for that, I write this to you. A tribute. An accolade. For being a part of this world. For being able to survive. For your energy. For your existence.

I’m currently getting my BA in Psychology and I am a first generation college student (so most of the help I have received in terms of what in the world I am doing with myself has come from google, the occasional conversation with professors, and reddit). I am supposed to be graduating this time next year and have been building up a “nice” transcript/GPA in hopes of continuing on to get my masters.\\nHere’s where I need help/advice. I want to be a child psychologist with education/experience if not certification in the world of play therapy. I took part in a practicum recently that unveiled my love for working with children and a desire to dedicate myself to learning play therapy practices in specific. I have some interest in adolescents as well but I have almost completely leaned away from working exclusively with adults since my freshman year. I decided on a masters because while I want to publish things in the future (maybe a book or two who knows nothing too fancy)… I do not think a PhD or the “title of being a doctor” is necessary for me to do so. Which is the impression I was under before… to be respected I “must” pursue the highest education possible.\\nAnyways, would the best route be to pursue a masters program focused on mental health counseling but specify my concentration in child development/child psychology? Is clinical psychology a better approach for this? Are there any universities in particular with programs that would best fit my situation? Any bits of knowledge or concepts I do not seem to fully understand?\\nI have a list of some schools I am interested in that have been accredited by the APA and some if not most also being accredited by the play therapy association. Yes, I have looked into them and the many professors behind the various programs… but everything feels so much more overwhelming than it probably is. I am starting to freak myself out, convince myself that I do not know what I am doing, and overall I have been stuck in a loop for a few months of googling the same questions over and over only to find the same answers that send me back into the loop again. I know that social work and marriage counseling are things I would like to stay away from if at all possible.\\nAgain, I’m sorry for the blurb, I truly do not know what else to do except ask for help.

       "  'selftext': \"Ive always kind of known, since I was a 15-16 year old teenager, that I am apparently abrasive to some people.  I dont quite know what it is, because it's not often you have an opportunity to ask people why they dont like you.  Im assuming it's actually not how I am saying something, but actually what I am saying in most instances.  \\n  \\n  Im pretty quick witted and I love poking fun at things, and I think that I raise people's guard quickly, because I dont really act any differently towards strangers as I do with my friends.  I dont have a guard until people give me a reason for me to have one, so I basically treat people the same.  I realize isnt necessarily the best approach, but I dont really enjoy anyone's company that takes life too seriously.  So I feel like my personality tends to weed out people, that to me, are too uptight and rigid.  \\n  \\n  Abrasive is probably a the best word to describe me upon first meeting me, despite the fact that I dont have any ill-intent, ever.  If I have ill-intent in my words, that person, and anyone who hears it, would definitely know I were serious.  However, at any job or hobby (involving others) that ive ever had, after a certain amount of time, I seem to befriend every single person, regardless of gender, nationality, etc. etc..  I work in a restaurant with people from 16 to 56.  Most are in their 30s, but I get along with everyone.  The older folks, the younger folks, man or woman, doesnt matter they all will seek me out to just chat.  \\n  \\n  It's really great when you *gel* with everyone, but it can take me a while to win some people over.  Ive been there a year, and up until just a few months ago, one of your servers was a little standoffish towards me, but nowadays she busts my balls right back and we joke around like brother sister.  When you first meet me you may not like me, but I grow on you, because I think people realize I have good heart and intent (I hope), and that im someone you can confide in and seek advice from.  I think it's pretty clear by this post that im definitely opinionated, but im extremely flexible.  Ill occasionally make wild statements like 'X always happens when Y goes down', and im only partially serious and im usually being quite hyperbolic.  \\n  \\n  So I was kind of curious what everyone here thinks that *other people* think of them?  I love some good ol' fashioned introspection.  I also think it's important to be polite and kind when youre around others, despite what you might be going through, so I try to be fairly jovial and upbeat, pretty much all the time.  Granted, when you cant hold in anymore, everyone around you knows something is going on, which then prompts everyone to ask *'Are you ok?'*, since everyone is legitimately concerned.  How do you find yourself blending with your co-workers?  Your family, friends?  Is there anything about yourself that youre actively working on changing?  Id like to be less openly opinionated, at least in situations where people dont know me that well.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Back when I was in college, I met the most amazing, beautiful girl. \\n\\nWe hit it off super quickly. We weren\\'t even on the same course as each other. I did engineering, she did art, we met on the bus.\\nWe\\'d meet up for drinks and to hang out after college, I couldn\\'t get enough of her.\\n\\nLooking back, we were extremely flirtatious with each other, I just didn\\'t see it at the time. \\nI really liked her, but I was in a serious relationship with my first proper girlfriend at the time. She was also in a serious relationship but broke things off with him pretty early into our friendship. This might have been a sign for me to do the same, I just didn\\'t see it at the time.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t happy in my relationship, but I found it hard to break things off after being together for so many years. There was this one time when my (now ex) girlfriend was away for the weekend. Me and my friend got quite drunk at a party, stripped down to our underwear, and started fooling around in bed. I still remember the warm feel of her skin. I knew it was wrong. We both did. We didn\\'t sleep with each other, although we might as well have, as I\\'d still consider what we did as cheating.\\n\\nWe never spoke about what happened. I remember asking her if she wanted to talk about it, but she didn\\'t. \\n\\nThere was another time, a year or two later, where we were out drinking with friends. I had finally broken up with my ex at this point, and it was the first time we\\'d gone out properly since. \\nThe two of us decided to split off from the group to go into a different bar for a few drinks. I was extremely drunk, but I can remember us making out like there was no tomorrow. \\nI remember waking up the next day vaguely remembering what happened. As I sobered up and my memories were coming back, I started to remember the night more clearly. I messaged her something along the lines of \"omg did we kiss last night??\". She didn\\'t want to talk about it. She was drunk and wasn\\'t in control.\\nI remember messaging my best friend later on that day to tell him what had happened. I was still excited that something had finally happened, even if she didn\\'t want to talk about it.\\nMy friend told me that she had kissed another one of the boys that night, too. I felt gutted. But we were both single, she has every right to kiss whoever she wants to.\\n\\nThings slowly went back to normal. If she didn\\'t want to talk to me about these things, I wasn\\'t going to pursue.\\n\\nA few months later, she sent me a Snapchat while she was on a night out. She sent a video of her saying something. All I can remember is that she was crying.\\nI was over a friend\\'s house at the time, and for some reason, I decided to watch the video with my phone muted. \\nI messaged her, apologising that I couldn\\'t hear her. I asked her if she was OK and if she wanted to talk. The next day, she got back to me, and she didn\\'t want to talk about it.\\n\\nAfter a few years of college, she went to university and met a new friend group, got a new boyfriend, etc. They didn\\'t last long.\\n\\n\\nAs the years went by, we slowly grew apart, until eventually we stopped contact completely. \\n\\nI\\'m in a new relationship now. 7 years down the line, and I\\'m feeling the same way as I did before, unsatisfied. For years, I\\'d think of my old friend every single day, missing them and wondering what they\\'re up to. I struggle in this relationship and with previous ones, constantly comparing girls with her. I know I shouldn\\'t, and I feel deeply guilty about it.\\n\\nI\\'ve recently stopped smoking weed after several years of addiction. \\nAlthough I don\\'t think about her as much anymore, I\\'ve recently started having dreams again. I\\'ve had a few dreams about her now. Last night was the most vivid one so far. I dreamt that we had met up with each other, along with a few other college friends. We ended up having a deep conversation about what\\'s happened to us over the years and why I haven\\'t reached out to her. This resulted in me finally leaving my current girlfriend and giving things a shot with her instead. \\n\\nThere\\'s been a few times when I\\'ve wanted to message her to ask if she wants to meet up. I feel like I\\'ve matured a lot over the years (I\\'m now 29), so maybe she\\'d be happy to talk things through with me now? \\nShe hasn\\'t been on social media for a few years now. Every time I\\'ve looked for her, she\\'s never there. \\nI haven\\'t heard anything about her in years, from anyone. I bet she\\'s travelling the world, doing amazing things. \\nI know things would never work out between us, I doubt I\\'ll even see her ever again. I just wish I could have the chance to talk to her one last time. I have so many unanswered questions.\\n\\nMan, I miss her.',\n",

(He, myself, and my husband are all Washington graduates, so please no comment on the game) and we popped the question after the game.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ll spare you all the emotional moments of that, but he said yes, he would.  His move-in date is tentatively scheduled for the weekend after Memorial Day.  That gives him time to pack, sell the house, and anything else he needs to do before then.  A couple of my husband\\'s friends are going to help us in cleaning the house, doing touch up yard work, and moving him over here.  So, it all turned out well.  I think it will be emotional for him to leave that house, but we\\'ll deal with that when we get to it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFunny note - we called my brother afterwards to tell him that it was all taken care of.  I talked to my niece who usually stayed in my bedroom when my brother and family came to visit.  She stayed in my old room, which looked the same as it did when I graduated high school.  She\\'s 10 now, but asked what\\'s going to happen to a poster I had up in the room.  It was a bare-chested model in the surf with the headline, \"A hard man is good to find\".  So she sheepishly asked me what was going to happen to it.  She didn\\'t want any details about dad\\'s move, just wanted to know what was going to happen with my poster.  she said it made her feel safe, and I commented that it made me feel something too, which is why I had it up.  She responded as if I had just said something really gross and said quietly, \"OOh.  You\\'re talking about sex, right?\"  guess at 10, she still thinks it and boys are gross, though that didn\\'t stop her from inquiring about the poster.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for the advice and comments.  they were a great help in calming me down and helping to figure out what to do.',\n",

I throw something on to go pick them up out of bed and begin our morning. I let the dog out and grab a water.  \\n\\n“daddy can we watch a cartoon?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. What do you wanna watch?\\n\\nOne of them picks a show while the other loses their mind. I scoop them up into my arms and give them sleepy morning cuddles and explain tomorrow is their turn and we take turns. We settle in and I pull the blanket over us as we wake up together and wipe the sleep out of my eyes. \\n\\n“Daddy can we have breakfast?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. What do you wanna eat?\\n\\nThey select their respective morning food, typically cereal or oatmeal.. sometimes pancakes if I have a little extra time. I give them their breakfast, let our dog back in, and feed him as well. Give him some morning scruffs and loving pats. I check my phone to see what time it is. I hear her foot steps from around the corner. \\n\\n“Hey can you make me a coffee?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. \\n\\nI turn on the coffee maker and get her mug around and start up the coffee. I head over to the bathroom and turn on the shower. Waters cold again. It does that in the winter, something about a filter getting debris caught. \\n\\n“Is the water cold?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. I’ll be right back. \\n\\nFix her coffee just the way she likes and I leave it on the counter. Walk by the kids and give them little head pats. Tell them I’ll be right back, the water is cold again. Go to the basement and tap on the filter until I hear the water turn over. I get ready for work and head out of the day. I’m only there for a few minutes. \\n\\n“Hey, can you to handle this account? Someone called off today.”\\n\\nYeah, no problem\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter I feel like I’m drowning sometimes with the amount of things stacked on my desk. Same four walls I’ll probably die in. It gives me what I need to barely scrape by but it’s enough. I make sure the kids have what they need, I make sure she has her hobbies. I’ll do what I can if it’s possible. \\n\\n“Hey I’m heading out early. Do you mind covering for me?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. \\n\\nI’ll never let them know what I’m feeling. I’ll keep my nose to the grind stone and provide what life I can. They deserve it… I deserve it… right? Every night when I get home the kids hold the door closed and I have to summon all my strength to open it but man, a 5 year old and 3 year old… they are formidable. \\n\\n“I’m not feeling good. Do you mind if I go lay down?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. \\n\\nI won’t tell her about my day and how hectic it was. I won’t tell her I’m feeling overwhelmed and socialized out. I won’t tell her I’m on the verge of a melt down. Little eyes and ears always watching and listening for their superhero to come be… super. \\n\\n“Daddy can we watch what you’re doing?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. \\n\\nThey sit with me and chat to each other and ask me what I’m doing 1000 times and I answer each time, even if it’s what I just said 10 seconds ago. They deserve a dad who wants them around as much as they want him to be around. They don’t deserve the childhood I had. I give them their dinners and take a helping to her. Kids and I eat together and I ask about their day. \\n\\n“Daddy, can we play a game?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. \\n\\nWe decide what we want to play and it’s always their favorite turtle game. I crawl around with a blanket over me and they pretend to be dinosaurs and eat me alive. We wrestle and romp until they need to start getting ready for bed. \\n\\n“Hey after we put the kids to bed, don’t forget to clean up the kitchen.”\\n\\nYeah, no problem. \\n\\nExcept, it’s pretty much done. I did the dishes while dinner was cooking. I even started laundry while I was eating. I picked up the living room, vacuumed, tidied everything up because I like things to be simple and clean. I sit down after finishing up what we used for dinner.\\n\\n“Hey can you cut me up a veggie bowl. I’m still a little hungry.”\\n\\nYeah, no problem.\\n\\nAt this point, this has been the same day. Over and over for who knows how long. I know it’s coming but nothing changes. Am I stuck in a loop? Everyone sees me as a great father. An amazing husband. I barely believe I qualify as anything good. I feel like I’m just floating through. After a little bit of time to play some video games and disconnect for a minute I’m getting ready for bed. \\n\\n“Hey can you scoop the cat litter?”\\n\\nYeah, no problem.\\n\\nHere I am.

I promise I\\'m not trying to promote anything, I\\'m just proud of my work.\\n\\nIt centers around an alien species called the Zmite, with whom humanity has integrated on a new planet called named Hope, and the power struggle between the governments of the planet as the mystery of humanity\\'s arrival over a thousand years ago begins to unravel.\\n\\nIn the first book, which takes place in the Kuiper Belt, a region of space beyond Neptune with a bunch of asteroids and planetoids, a group of protagonists face an unfolding horror as the secrets of life are close to being revealed and the Kuiper Administration begins to clamp down. In the end, humanity, which hasn\\'t left but has colonized all of the Sol system, is forced to take drastic measures to ensure the encroaching danger is snuffed out.\\n\\nThe two survivors from that book have made it to a new planet called Hope in a one-way shot aboard a cryogenics-equipped ship in the sequel. Now, almost a thousand Earth-years later, the ship they rode in on is revered as sacred, and humanity, birthed from embryos aboard the ship, is thriving in a hybrid human-alien society with the Zmite. Something is lurking in the skies above though, and when a mysterious ship crash lands on Hope (this is the first time other aliens, besides humans, have visited the planet), the slumbering secrets of the ancient human ship begin to unfurl. \\n\\nI plan on making this a series, with epic space battles, romance, action, mysteries, and suspense. A space opera, if you will. There is a galactic federation controlled by a deep state known as the Invilave that knows of humanity\\'s sacrifice, and a confederated government known as the Outer Allied Worlds, who does not. The tension between them plays an integral part to the story as the horrors from the first book begin to rear their ugly heads again, threatening the entire galaxy. I plan on calling this series \"The Andromeda Crisis\".\\n\\nWhat are your WIPs, series\\', or favorite stories you\\'ve written? I love talking writing with people and would love to hear yours.

I called her back later and as we were talking, she questioned me about something I said near the end of the previous ft. She claims that I said “i have a sleeping pig ceremony” and she was very confused by this and told me to repeat myself to which i apparently said “my sleeping pig ceremony” again. I have zero memory of saying this and i normally recall things pretty easily so im very confused as to why i might not have remembered saying this. It’s also a weird phrase lol.

       "  'selftext': 'What is the purpose of life? Who am I meant to be? Everyone lives a different life, has different experiences. Some have it hard, and some start better. But we must all admit that no one\\'s life is perfect. No one in this world has never felt sadness. Sometimes I think how we clueless humans were just put on Earth some day. How? We do not know. A higher power? We evolved? Or something else we haven\\'t even thought of. In all these years, we invented things. They had all advantages but also disadvantages. Was life maybe better when we were just surviving in the wild? When there weren\\'t apps that took you to mindless scrolling, disconnecting from life. When there weren\\'t cars to cause accidents. When there weren\\'t beauty standards, or maybe there were. Because if you look closely into history, you see that we all needed to fit a standard, that changed after a while though. Now we are meant to fit beauty standards, never be sad, and enjoy life. But it is hard to stay positive.\\n\\nI can\\'t say that, though; I actually have a good life. But still I\\'m sad most times?\\n\\nI\\'m a bit scared. Scared of the bad people in this world. There are bad people; you can\\'t help but admit how humans can be so selfish. I don\\'t even get how conflicts start. Even the Roman empire had conflicts. They wanted to feel pride, accomplish something, selfish. Because in every conflict, there are innocent people getting hurt. But accomplishment is a big thing for humans. If you do not strive for something, you kind of get lost in time. Like, for example, my brother, he\\'s pretty smart but doing badly in school. I always see him playing games; I see how proud he is he has got to another level. But I know deep down that he wants to do more. I also want to do more. But I can\\'t since I\\'m in middle school. But still, you could study harder, be healthier, show more kindness, try to make money, and so on. But I don\\'t because I find comfort in doing absolutely nothing. But should you get out of that comfort or not? Many people stay in their comfort zone their whole life. Because what if you get hurt?\\n\\nAnyway, let\\'s talk about a basic human\\'s life; we get put on this earth knowing nothing. Some face mental challenges or sickness, which is so unfair. We learn through school, and for younger people, even social media. Some graduate, some can\\'t get jobs. We try our best to be happy in this world. Personally, I feel better being surrounded by love. My parents, I do not even know what I would do without them. If they faced challenges, I wouldn\\'t understand why a higher power would do that if it existed.\\n\\nBut not many people experience love. Grown up in a challenging household or never made friends. Some people are alone on Christmas. I think about that a lot. I told my parents when I\\'m older, I\\'m inviting a lonely person in my home for Christmas. Because personally, I think Christmas is about love, not giving trendy gifts from social media. My mom told me I shouldn\\'t do that. I should be careful because there are dangerous people out there. And that\\'s true. But not all, right? Right? Some maybe just made mistakes and are being neglected and don\\'t get love. But maybe some deserved it because some young person getting assaulted does not deserve that. Anyone really can be assaulted, that\\'s what I hate most about humans. They put people in a group \"men,\" \"women,\" \"a race,\"... . That\\'s actually so wrong to say that one WHOLE group of people are the same as some people in that group. I hate that people stereotype. I hate that people hate or gossip, cause admit people thrive on bringing someone down.\\n\\nWhy can\\'t we live in a safe world? A world where everyone can help each other, be kind, not get hurt... Maybe on a different planet? In this whole universe full of mysteries (like many mysteries that we can\\'t solve and I think of in a shower). But maybe that\\'s not possible because everything that lives isn\\'t always kind. Like animals, the circle of life. Maybe it just isn\\'t scientifically possible.\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about the internet. I don\\'t know why it was designed. Maybe to put people out of their miseries? To make them forget what a challenging world they live in. Does anyone also get that kick of realization after finishing a movie or series or even books? Now there isn\\'t just that; you have people who cook, talk, and humans connect, which actually is a good thing, but not always. You know what I also don\\'t get? Famous people. People worship them. Why? They are also just humans? They also have feelings, also live.\\n\\nDoes anyone also look back on their photos once a month? And cry of sadness or happiness? Looking back on happy memories. But I don\\'t actually know if I was happy then. No one knows one\\'s true feelings if they just put a smile on their face because the person behind the camera said \"smile.\" You never know someone truly or you do not know for sure you can trust them because sadly there are bad people in this world.\\n\\nLet\\'s take it back from the beginning. What IS the purpose of life? Because we\\'re clueless humans, even the smartest people do not know. You can say you\\'re wise but do you TRULY know? I will say my theory. I know that we were put on this world, I see it as a path. All wobbly paths, but some even more challenging. As a child you learn more and more about the world. Many people are afraid of the world. So am I. But I think that the purpose of life is to try to be happy. Cause we only got 1 life. (I think) Loving humans or animals or something else, enjoying the small moments and even the bad ones, finding a purpose, working towards being the best version of yourself, connecting with people because there wasn\\'t one but multiple people put on this world. That\\'s my theory, but that may evolve as I get older.\\n\\nI do not know why I wrote this. Guess I think too much. Or want to be able to change the world. To not let people hate each other, connect with each other, to not let people feel so alone they harm their only life (I think) they have. I genuinely want everyone to be happy. But many people take advantage of kindness. So should I be selfish? Bring other people down to make me feel like I\\'m at the top? Be like any human being and just copy ? What if I get hurt of i just be myself?\\n\\nI do not know what life will throw my way. I do know that everyone has a different life, different beliefs, different hobbies/ things they like, different bodies, different races, different families, born in different times,... We should embrace our differentness. We should let people do their own thing. Focus on our own, help the people who have it hard. Because be honest, everyone wants to be happy, live their \"perfect\" life, but that is impossible. But for everyone, that\\'s different.\\n\\nLife is a wobbly path, but when you fall and get a wound, get up and keep going; wounds heal even if it takes long or doesn\\'t get the help or love it needs. I believe because there are so many people in this world everyone would find someone they truly love, even after many divorces. I do not know how to end this, but if anyone read this whole paragraph. Wow 😧',\n",

My brother is the type of person that never consumes a crumble of food unless you put in front of him. I like citrus especially squeezing my orange juices or eating them as is. That day the markets around me either out of oranges or the ones that remains couldn't convince me to spend my money for them.\\n\\nAnyway at one market I saw pretty nice looking clementines and bought about 2-2,5 kg of them. During the day I peeled and gave my brother 4-5 of them like the cartoon character did. It went like that for a few days and after that my brother started to do the same thing for me. We were playing Minecraft together at that time so any time one of us takes a break comes back with two clementines for each of us. I'm pretty sure we ate about 30-35 kg clementines during that month. \\n\\nSince than it became a gag, an inside joke between us. Whenever citrus season starts and some good fruits take place on markets at least one of us buys a bag of them and surprise the other one. With more moderate amounts of course.\",\n",

After some deep thought I told myself if I wanted to move out there I gotta acquire job skills to able to get a job that pays more and has better hours. So after looking into possible career fields, I’ve landed on becoming an EMT. And before any EMTs come in here telling me that becoming an EMT doesn’t pay well and all of that, I know, I’m just really gravitated towards that field for a nice change of pace, besides it pays slightly better than my current warehouse job. And from everyone I told in there, they all said I should go for it, don’t stay here for any longer, make us proud. So I want to do it! Make them proud and Improve myself.\\n\\nThe application process for it has been is easy so far, the only thing I’ve been stuck on is studying for the TEAS exam. My main issue that comes from it is that I don’t know where to start, literally that’s the only thing stopping me. There’s no clear direction on what I should be studying for, what are the IMPORTANT things I need to know to able to pass the exam. I know theirs a science, math, English, reading portions in the exam but what exactly from each category I need to know, I haven’t been in high school for 3 years so all of that science and math stuff is probably down the drain in the black void of my mind. Hell, I technically passed high school with dumb luck due to the pandemic, I was supposed to fail junior year.\\n\\nOverall I just don’t want the possibility of me becoming an EMT crushed just because I’m mentally paralyzed on where to study for this exam. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please and thank you to all of you.',\n",

A lot of oil, butter, cold cuts, bread, chips, ice cream, etc.\\n\\nI never gave any of it thought. I knew it was not healthy, but like many things we like and dont want to give up, its easier to not think about the fact that I am actively making a choice to do damage to myself. Bad things happen to other people. \\n\\nBut then I started to realize that bad things happen to anyone. Someone close to me got a heart attack. I could feel my pulse getting higher after eating certain meals. It didnt feel healthy. Sometimes got heart palpitations after meals, mild, but still concerning to me since I even though I knew it didnt probably mean I would drop dead right there and then, what I ate was probably a main reason for them.\\n\\nI started to research what I should eat. I came to the conclusion that based on the current science we have, dropping all (I have occasional cheat days though, mostly only if I am out and eating with people) meat and dairy products and oils and added sugar from my diet was a good choice. This automatically meant dropping almost all processed foods because its nigh impossible to find any processed foods that do not have added oil in them. \\n\\nEating healthy isnt just about what to not eat but also what to eat. Getting all the necessary nutrients is a must, supplimenting is necessary in some cases, like with vitamin b12. I am looking and researching more stuff a bit day by day. I never ate fruits before. Went almost my entire life without eating almost any fruits. Maybe 5 fruits per year if even that. Now I love fruits. I buy some seasonal fresh vegetables or other vegetables that are always cheap. Others I buy frozen. Lentils, legumes, rice, potatoes, beans. Lately I have been eating rice and lentils with an asian influenced sauce with vegetables. Its quite cheap to eat food like this, cheaper than when I ate meat.\\n\\nI have to say its been very good for me, its interesting getting to try new foods.\\n\\nIts never too late to make better decisions.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"For those of you who don't know me (which is everyone, how fun is that?), I like to come on here the night before my birthday and think about the year before. It started when I was 17, friendless, and spent \\\\*way\\\\* too much time online. Although I only hop on reddit for r/succulents questions these days, I've kept up with my birthday night-before posts. I love them, in all of their sappiness. Feel free to laugh at 'em. I do too.\\n\\n[Last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/10c9gko/im_turning_20_in_90_minutes/), my life was quiet. Moving into 20, I wanted to work on that. I said I wanted to feel more secure in my friends. I wanted to be less tired. I said I wanted to stop focusing so much on who I wanted to be, and just be. Profound, I know. As I started my 20s, I wanted to trust and have fun and own mistakes and let it all happen. And I'm happy to say that I did. Not perfectly, of course. It was only my first 20-something year. But I finally have what I believe to be a positive life update. Finally.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThis year, a lot happened to me. It was all rooted in two major life events. Two might not sound like a lot, but it was a lot to me. This is my life and I am very biased and dramatic. Dangerous combination.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThe first event was my first-ever big-kid adult job! Well, an internship. It fell in my lap at the last minute because someone else accepted and then rejected it. If I met that someone I think I would be obligated to marry them, or donate a kidney. I am so very grateful.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThe organization was prestigious, and I've dreamed of working for them since I was a little kid (I am deathly afraid of writing out the name, my apologies). They're the kind of prestigious that attracts people from all over the world and so I got to meet people my age from aaaaall over the world. I made more friends than I ever have. Not tried and true friends per se, but fun friends. The kind that push you to have a good time, to be social. And I needed a good push. \\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nMy friends helped me get to know my hometown and state through tourists’ eyes, and I loved the way they saw it all. I went on spontaneous trips, hiked through torrential downpours, went to local festivals, and accidentally became a groupy for the shittiest garage band I’ve ever heard. I talked my way over an international border. I sang karaoke the night before our favorite dive bar closed, may she rest in peace. I compiled a truly kickass business-professional wardrobe. I saw space shit that blew my mind. I had the best summer of my life, and I’ll never forget it. And even though we’ll never all be together again, I eagerly look forward to what’s ahead. I know so many of these people will do great things. I know I’ll send them Christmas cards fifteen years from now, and tell my kids about our silly adventures when they ask. I’ll be proud to have known them, even if only for a little while. I’m so excited for more seasons of life like this one.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThe second major life event was my first-ever big-kid adult relationship! And my first bre@k up (censored to keep peace with the mods, much respect to you all homies). I will not be divulging the messy details to you. Partially because I don’t want to bore you or start crying right now. And I respect that there should be some boundaries between me and the internet. But mostly because I recently counted and found that I have written 42 pages about this boy in my journal. 42. That’s psychotic. That’s delusional. I need to be stopped! I’m feeling better now, and am extremely grateful for the experience. Both the rise and fall of it all. He was very pretty after all. Oops.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nThis year I also became very close and comfortable with my school friends. They’re not new or anything, we’ve been together for three years now. But I love them and they love me. And I am so grateful for them and every agonizing hour we spend studying together. Every single one is made better by their company and laughter. I love my friends.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nWith all that to consider, here’s what I’m looking for in 21: More of this. More friends and laughter and living. More new experiences and travel and excitement and good books. And more contentedness regarding my bre@k up because, boy oh boy, that was \\\\*not\\\\* fun. I can finally properly relate to Taylor Swift songs, but God at what cost?\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nIn all seriousness, I just want to enjoy being young. I am tremendously excited to one day settle down and have a family. But it can wait. I want to have fun. I want to have stories to tell my kids and I want them to make me seem \\\\*way\\\\* cooler than my future spouse. I want to enjoy it all. After my teenage years, I’ve got a lot of catching up to do. But this was a good start.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nA very good start.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\nAs always, thank you to my 5-20 dedicated readers who happened to be online right now. You’re the real MVPs here. Get home safe. I’ll see you next year.\\r\",\n",

In that time i took a lot of training videos, learned how printers work, what differences the different technologies make in the final product, and I\\'ve done a LOT of analysis on ink cartridge pricing to make sure i knew EXACTLY what to recommend to customers no matter the situation.\\n\\nBut like... I feel like every time \\'printers\\' comes up on Reddit it\\'s always \"Ink costs more than blood!\" \"My printer locked me out of printing because it\\'s out of blue!\" And i always feel the knee jerk reaction to raise a finger and say \"It sounds like you were ill informed about your purchase\" but it never gets a good reaction. And they\\'re right, basically all printers are a price gauging scheme in one way or another, but it is a varied market with lots of choices and things to consider. Back when I actually worked in retail, finding someone lost in the printer aisle and taking the time to get them the product they needed was really heart warming. I had to consider market basket, add-ons and such, but I always pointed them toward a printer that was a good fit for what they needed.\\n\\nBuuut then the pandemic hit and we just had NOTHING for the longest time. It\\'s hard to talk to people and sell printers with no inventory. Eventually printers trickled in, but they were either bought up, or just not the right fit for a customer. It sucked ass, and eventually I left.\\n\\nIt was really nice to be able to help people with a niche issue. It was fun explaining the tech to people who were interested enough to hear about it. Not that i go into the nitty gritty, just \"Hey, Laser is better for highlighting because instead of liquid ink, it melts plastic onto paper, so no chance of smudges!\" little tidbits to seal the sell, y\\'know?\\n\\nI also used to repair and troubleshoot Drive Thru Headset equipment.

I actually found the topic to be really interesting, and I shit you not I can recite the whole paper and everything in detail, even though having only read it once. \\n\\nSo why is it that when reading something that I don't find interesting I have about 10 seconds of focus before my mind inevitably drifts off. I remember about 2 yrs ago when I was studying for a big test (equivalent to the SATs) I was reading a textbook on social studies, I had to constantly reread everything because my mind kept drifting off. I repeatedly found myself having read a whole chapter without remembering anything. \\n\\nWhen I was in high school this wasn't really an issue because I could just go to class and not have to read too much on my own. But now in college I have to study more after class, which means I'm barely passing the courses I don't like. \\n\\nNow, the big problem! The reason this is even an issue is because I've found that I don't really care about what I study. I knew going into engineering studies that it was only temporary because my big interest lies in psychology. Psych studies is very popular in my country so it might take a few years before I get accepted (I will keep retaking the entrance test), and therefore I needed to get my studies started somewhere, hence engineering.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo I would need some advice on how to better remember things when studying/reading something that I don't find interesting. No matter what I study in the future It's inevitable that there will be courses and things I will have to learn that I don't like, so I figured; might as well try different study methods and get better now. \\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice? \",\n",

We worked from home all the way through lockdown and when the restrictions finally began to lift no one expressed any real interest in going back to the office at all, aside from me who opted to go into the office once or twice a week.\\n\\nI'm very shy and not great at conversations. The pandemic tore away literally any social skills that I did have. I speak to only a few colleagues while at the office and it's only nicities, nothing deep or anything like that. I hate small talk. I'm also far younger than anyone else. Most of my colleagues are older women who have their own lives, cars, families and homes.\\n\\nCommunication from my friends has also been extremely choppy, it's very hard to get them to actually have a meaningful conversation with me over Facebook or whatever, and most of the time I'm just left on read anyway. We used to go out a lot before COVID but even after restrictions eased we never returned to our usual routine.\\n\\nI don't have a car and because I'm working from home so much and living with family I don't see the need to get one. My friends have cars and physically travel to work. When I'm in the office, I catch the bus. I've never had a partner and, although I'm not necessarily looking, I feel that being locked away for so long has taken away from me not just relationship opportunities but life opportunities as well.\\n\\nI feel stuck and left behind. To me, it may as well still be 2020, only that the common international struggle of being confined to your home is no longer there. I feel like the world has resumed without me and I'm trying to play catch up. I don't want to return to the office full time because half the time it's a very lonely experience. I struggle to talk to people and sometimes they opt to stay home anyway, so I'm in an office all by myself.\\n\\nAll I do to keep myself from going crazy is play video games, read and listen to music. Even while working from home while family are out it's a very lonely experience unless someone emails or calls you, and even then it's strictly work-related. The positive human contact that I've had since 2020 has been very few and far between, I find it so hard to actually reach out to someone who will talk to me for more than 5 minutes about something I'm actually interested in.\\n\\nFor those of you who are still working from home, or who had worked from home, do you or did you have similar problems? I don't think the fact that I was just barely getting started with life when the pandemic hit helped very much.\",\n",

We lived together for 2+ years. She was a couple years older than me and loved to cook, keep a tidy house, and host the occasional dinner party with finger foods and wine. We actually became friends, partly because we studied wildly different things and could kvetch to each other without worrying that word would get out to our colleagues. We’d plan roommate dinners and even adopted a cat (though she was the owner). She traveled a lot for her degree, so the summer before I got a window AC and she was away, she let me sleep in her room so I didn’t get sautéed. If we ever had disagreements, we could easily resolve them with a discussion. We even started relationships around the same time. She was one of my first friends in grad school. The start of my degree was really tough and I often came home totally wiped, so it was weirdly comforting to know that I had a safe place to call my own (not to be taken for granted!). \\n\\nAnyway, I eventually moved out to have my own place with my fiancé (then my boyfriend), but we stayed friends and are still friends to this day. When I moved out, actually, she gave me one of her candles that she knew I liked. She still lives very close by, so I just catsat for her over the holidays. Walking into the old apartment and smelling the house smell (you know what I mean) instantly took me back to how that place was a haven to me for years. Honestly, this reads like a love letter now that I look back on it, but I’m just really grateful to have had a roommate who was decent. And obviously no shade at my fiancé, who had some pretty big shoes to fill and delivered in every way. ;)\\n\\nShe’s the best.',\n",

The same can be done with Ai generated average or creepy looking people.\\n\\nUnless they have particularly uncanny and unusual or disproportionate features, I feel like comments like that come from a chronically online mentality.

I scoffed and cringed at the start but after watching for a bit i just realised how human the 2 of them were. He dressed up this way to cheer up his sister and his sister was happy with what he did. It was so simple but because it was simple it was beautiful. It started clicking in my mind then that we all are not so different yet very unique.

       "  'selftext': 'I was hanging out with my friend at his store, and I kinda zoned out while he was talking to customers. I started thinking about how close a person should be for me to show up at their mother\\'s funeral. Do they have to be a friend? Or someone I went to school with? Or a co-worker? You know, just random thoughts that come up in your head while zoned out. Then I started thinking about people for whom I would go to their mother\\'s funeral if she dies. The first person who came to my mind was a guy I went to high school with, and he also lives near me. Then my friend started talking to me, so I forgot about whatever I was thinking about. I went home, chilled for a bit, and then entered the bathroom to do number 2. I always like to check out Facebook or Twitter on my phone while using the bathroom. I opened Facebook, scrolled for a bit, and saw the guy I was thinking about earlier posting about his mother\\'s death yesterday. I felt sad, left a condolence comment, and kept scrolling, not realizing that it was the same person who came to mind earlier. It took me five minutes to realize that I was thinking about it literally an hour ago. I was kinda in shock. I started looking for reasons that might\\'ve made me think of that person specifically, like maybe I heard people talking about it outside without paying much attention or something. Keep in mind, when I mentioned that I \"started thinking of people that I would show up to their mother\\'s funeral,\" the first and only person that came to my mind was him before my friend cut off my string of thoughts. But yeah, this is my first post on here. I just joined this Reddit today to share this coincidence with you because it is kind of freaking me out. I might be overreacting about it and it\\'s not that crazy of a coincidence. But thinking of the odds of that happening is mind blowing to me.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"There seem to be two types of people: those with an inner monologue and those without (of course it's probably more of a spectrum). I've never really had an IM, my brain just flits between ideas without ever bothering to put them into words, unless I'm talking or writing, in which case I am forced to articulate these thoughts into a linear string of words. Since I've started thinking about IMs, I've developed this nagging feeling that my lack of an IM has limited the depth of my thought. My brain is quite used to flitting between thoughts without words, and so I find it's hard to really go deeper with a single thought. You really need language to manage the logistics of a really complex idea. I mean think about those people who do memory competitions. They all use the technique of a memory castle: they tie up the information to be remembered in a linear story with lots of imagery. And much like the information to be memorized in these competitions, complex ideas require on-the-fly management of large amounts of data. So it makes sense to me that complex ideas might too require a linear narrative... a stream of consciousness... an inner monologue oO\\n\\nFunnily, both camps (IM n/IM) seem to live a large portion of their lives not knowing the other camp exists. I was a sophomore in college when a friend of mine expressed his incredulity that another friend of ours *didn't* have an inner monologue. I realized then that I, in fact, do not have an inner monologue. I knew people had IMs because they talk about it all the time, but no one really talks about not having an IM (sensing a pattern...). \\n\\nAnyway, I feel I could develop my IM if I worked at it, and I have been able to improve it a bit, but this taste of the IM life has started to make me a bit wary of it. Maybe it's not so bad that I don't have an inner monologue. It seems like it could get quite exhausting and intrusive and possibly even impact sleep. See this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/14op8xy/is_it_true_that_people_have_an_inner_monologue_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\\n\\nWhat should I do? Should I develop my IM and risk irreversibly creating a worse existence for myself? Is the risk even real? Maybe IM is more of a muscle that needs exercise rather than a flip that gets switched. \",\n",

Did you talk to the friend about everything going on and ultimately end the friendship ie like you would a relationship or did you just slowly and gradually distance yourself from the friendship? \\n\\nSo the friendship I have with my best friend isn’t doing it for me anymore. We used to talk and see each other often but then I unfortunately had to move and ever since then we don’t really talk and obviously don’t see each other. My friend also has a tendency to be a crappy texter so I may not hear back for weeks if not longer even if I need to talk to her about something. Case in point over a month ago I reached out to talk to her about something important and since then Ive gotten 2 messages which consist of her asking for updates but not addressing anything Ive stated. I’m pretty sure she and her boyfriend of 3 months broke up so I imagine she’s probably preoccupied with that but I can’t confirm cause she hasn’t told me that they’ve actually broken up (I heard from someone else they might not be together anymore). \\n\\nAnd that’s really how our friendship has gone since I’ve moved. Whenever I have mentioned anything to her about this I just get told not to take it personal and that this person still values and views me as one of their best/close friends but for me their actions speak otherwise. \\n\\nEssentially, I’m not getting the support I need from my friend and my friend in a lot of ways keeps me in the dark about things going on in her life until later so it feels less like a friendship now a days and more like acquaintances. Which you guys will say is fine and let it go but the issue is my friend will text me randomly apologizing about not responding and then it’s just a cycle where I don’t think we ever actually talk about anything. \\n\\nI don’t want to hurt my friend either so I guess that’s where I’m stuck at.

Face was red, pimples and spots everywhere, some small some large, with puss and pain to the touch. For over two years, if not more I can\\'t remember, treatment wasn\\'t working. Creams, ointments, soaps nothing was successful.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe had heard about Roaccutane which is the branded name for accutane in Europe. I recall the dermatologist back then had said to my mom \"As a doctor, I suggest taking the medication, but as a father I don\\'t\" - this quote had stayed in my head but didn\\'t really realize what the doctor had meant, now I do. I knew it could stunt growth but I didn\\'t know the extent of it or how likely it\\'d be. My parents didn\\'t really want me to take it and I was really pressuring them, it wasn\\'t a great time for us, but I don\\'t remember it, it\\'s just what they recently told me. We ended up deciding to take the medication.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI did two (I believe it was six months) courses, one wasn\\'t successful. My mom was taking me to an orthopedic while taking the medication to track my growth, growth at that age was normal she recently told me. After the treatment was over my face was finally clean, no scars no marks no nothing, literally like nothing ever happened.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThen after school I went abroad to study at a very good university, we stopped tracking my growth, I kept growing though. I\\'d come back and they\\'d admire and praise my height, and how handsome I was.

They explained the situation and for some reason it was almost brand new information for me, I had forgotten about all these, I never thought it affected my height. All this time I thought I was as tall as I was supposed to be. My parents at the table explained that I was supposed to be taller than my dad and due to Roaccutane I missed out about 5CM (2inches) height, if not more. Naturally I was meant to be taller than my dad and my growth was normal while it was tracked but then I left and we had to stop tracking. They explained that they didn\\'t want me to take the medication but for months I was raising hell to take the pills (sounds very likely I\\'d do something like that) and I wouldn\\'t back down. I was worried about scarring my face from acne and that was my main argument to them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt got me thinking how my life would have been if I hadn\\'t taken the Roaccutane. I\\'d be lucky to be 6ft+ in height, I\\'d be considered tall, maybe I\\'d have scars on my face, maybe not. I don\\'t know if I should regret the decision I made back then or feel happy that my face is clean, I have a normal good height and I get a lot of looks from people. But I can\\'t help but feel remorse. I don\\'t blame my parents, I don\\'t blame anyone, not even myself, but I just wonder how I\\'d be and how awesome it would be to be very tall. It\\'s a shock to find out that you could have been taller if you hadn\\'t taken the medication, and it just makes you wonder that\\'s all.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Story time.\\n\\nI 31M, moved from the east coast to Texas with a buddy of mine I grew up with. I was in the military and since separating I’ve lived in a few different states. I finally moved back to the east coast and him and I got together for drinks. He jokingly asks where I’m going next because my friends know I don’t stay in one place for long. I told him I was thinking about Texas. Warmer, more affordable, potentially better job opportunities. He said well, if you need a roommate I’m down. We’re from a small town of about 10,000 people. Either you leave or you’re stuck there like most hometowns. Not my smartest idea but I took him up on that. This was August 2022 when we had the conversation and by January 2023 we had a uhaul packed and heading to Texas.\\n\\nFrom the jump it was nerve wracking. He didn’t really want to pay for the uhaul. He was late on rent the second month and basically every month after. Quit his job about 4 months in. Not very wise on my part. Made a hasty decision and was paying for it. Then he got with a woman around April or May and I didn’t see him for a couple weeks 😂. He came to the house once and I was like dude are you good? He told me about the woman and said she wanted him to move in. Not a big deal I was enjoying having the house to myself. Just worried he’d stop paying rent. \\n\\nAround the beginning of June he texted me and said he was gonna pick some stuff up. He comes over with his lady and a uhaul. I meet her, seriously good looking woman. He’s not a bad looking guy but I couldn’t believe he pulled her and she was super nice too. I asked about the uhaul and he says “her daughter is going to college and I’m gonna help them move her stuff, but while we have the uhaul I figured I’d come grab my stuff too.” So at this point I’ve learned his lady is old enough to have a daughter in college and that he’s moving out completely. Before he leaves I say “you’re still gonna pay your half here though right?” He says of course and then he’s out. This was June 2023, I’ve seen him once since then.\\n\\nThe whole time he’s living there SHE cash apps me his half of the rent. She’s invited me over for thanksgiving and football games, this guy never ranches out to me. One time the rent was late so I call him. His phone is off. Never calls back, never texts me, I just get a cashapp payment from her. He hasn’t grabbed his mail, told me to sell whatever things he forgot aside from that, I have no real contact with this guy. He did offer to go for drinks on my birthday though. One day I’m talking to my therapist and I tell him I was kind of jealous. This guy makes a move and after hardly any time finds a seemingly good woman who has her shit together, super nice, attractive, AND willing to pay his rent while he figures his life out. Meanwhile I’m pretty much doing it on my own and feeling pretty down and lonely. It was almost like a FOMO.\\n\\nWell fast forward to recently I get a text that says “hey man how you been?”. I got busy and didn’t respond. He texted me a little later and said “I fucked up and I bailed on you. I’m a shitty friend and I’m sorry.” I didn’t respond still. Really no clue what to say. Although I did appreciate it. Then a few hours go by and he tells me he’s likely moving back east because him and his girl are done. She allowing him to stay there until he can move himself back. I texted him back and said I was sorry to hear that and I appreciated the apology.  Everyone fucks up, and not to be too hard on himself. As you can imagine, our lease here is up next week and I already have plans to move to a smaller apartment. \\n\\nAfterwards it made me think, here I was jealous of this guys situation and now he’s back at square one.

       "  'selftext': \"I work for an ecommerce company and I see complaint after complaint about delivery drivers, and most of the complaints make it clear that the complainer is totally clueless about the delivery driver's job, or shipping in general.  I wanted to talk about this in hopes of creating some understanding and some realistic expectations, and hopefully some delivery drivers out there will read this and also add their two cents.\\n\\nA typical delivery driver has a manifest showing the stops they need to make and they are ordered according to location.  They are given barely enough time to make all these stops in a day, so all they have time to do is arrive at your location, and leave the package.  They do not have time to follow any special instructions, or call you when they're on their way.  One delay will back them up for the rest of the day, they have to keep moving.  They may even skip their lunch break to make up for those delays, though they're not supposed to.  They may even have to pee in a cup in their truck because they don't even have time to stop and use a bathroom.  Just like many other jobs, the schedule they've been given is tight to the point of being unreasonable.  If you require any special instructions for delivery to your home, forget it.  Use a lockbox or other delivery point instead.  If you're in an office and aren't under some contract which specifies delivery points in your building, they don't have time to distribute  your packages for you. They're going to the receptionist or the receiving area, dropping the stuff off, and leaving asap.\\n\\nWhomever packaged your items for shipping is supposed to pack them in a way so that the package can withstand a drop of several feet, and have a certain amount of weight put on top of it.  If the box is damaged, so what.  It's supposed to take the damage instead of your item getting damaged.  If your box shows signs of damage, it doesn't mean someone screwed up.  It means it was shipped, and ship happens (lol).   I see videos of delivery guys having to toss a package a short distance, and the comments from outraged people are funny to read.   If your item wasn't packed in a way that protects the item if it's tossed a few feet, then it's not the delivery guy's fault.  'Fragile' or 'This Side Up' markings on the box don't mean anything.  No one cares.  If it's truly fragile, then it needs to be packed very well because it's not going to get special treatment in shipping.  We've all gotten things delivered to us that were damaged before, and it sucks.  It's par for the course.  Do a return.  If you can't cope with this happening on occasion, then go buy your item in a store instead of having it delivered.\\n\\nThis is not intended to be a rant, I just want people to have realistic expectations about their deliveries.  If normal shipping/delivery functioned the way you think it should, it would cost a whole lot more, and you get what you pay for.  Can we give these delivery people a break?  They're busting their ass.\\n\\n&#x200B;\",\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Hello r/CasualConversation community! Recently, I've found myself indulging in a fascinating pastime: people watching. It's incredible what you can learn about life and humanity, just by observing.  \\nLet me take you through my experience from yesterday. I was nestled in my favorite corner of a bustling café, the aroma of coffee in the air, and a warm latte in my hand. As I glanced around, the café felt like a stage and each person, a character in their own unique story.  \\nThere was this young couple at the table across from me. They barely spoke a word, yet their eyes and subtle gestures wove a tale of deep understanding and comfort. It was like watching a silent movie, where emotions and thoughts were conveyed without a single spoken word.  \\n\\n\\n  \\nIn another corner, a group of friends reunited with such joyous laughter and enthusiastic hugs, it instantly brought a smile to my face. Each greeting was different – some with a quick handshake, others with a warm embrace – showcasing the diverse ways we express our affection and friendship.  \\nThen, there were the solitary visitors, absorbed in the digital world, fingers dancing over keyboards and eyes fixated on screens. It made me wonder about the invisible connections we make through technology – who were they talking to, what stories were being shared in those digital whispers?  \\nAmongst all this, the myriad of fashion choices was like a palette of human expression – bright colors, eclectic patterns, each outfit narrating its own story of individuality and choice.  \\nAs I sat there, lost in these observations, I realized that every person is a living story, rich and complex. The café was a microcosm of the larger world, each patron a reminder of the diverse tapestry of human life.  \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo, I turn to you, fellow Redditors – have you ever found yourself lost in the art of people watching? What stories have you silently observed? What little moments have stayed with you long after they passed? Let’s share and revel in the beautiful, often unnoticed, narratives that unfold around us every day.  \\n\",\n",

I’ve been stuck in this place in my life for awhile and this film really just gave me a little bit of the kick in the ass I needed to make a change for myself. I’ve never really known what I wanted to do with myself, what I wanted to make of my life because I didn’t think I’d ever make it past 16, 18, let alone 21, and now here I am, no plans, just going day by day feeling like everything and everyone is passing me by.\\n\\nIt really just resonated with me so much. The character Charlotte is very similar to how I am and around the same age as well. Just the way the scenes are shot and the aesthetics is everything to me. It’s the most “me” movie I’ve ever seen, if that makes sense.\\n\\nI lived in Korea for a short year so the way they depict those feelings (iykyk how it is being in a different county feeling a little lonely and isolated). During my time in Korea I formed a relationship to somebody very similar to Charlotte and Bob’s and that hit home too. Every single aspect. The end hits way too close to home too which tugs at my healing heart.\\n\\nI’m moving to Japan next year for work and will be spending two years there and I remember watching this movie for the second time and the reflections and the lights and just \\\\*Tokyo\\\\* made me feel a little less scared and just so excited. I’ve always wanted to go and now I’ll be living there but moving to a different country is always a little nerve-racking.\\n\\nThis film is just perfect to me. Definitely one of my comfort films and favorites now. The entire thing. The way the characters are portrayed, the environment, everything about it. I just feel it so much.',\n",

We agreed she would just rent my furniture, as we’ve been long time friends and she doesn’t wanna have to move a bunch in and I don’t wanna move a bunch out.\\n\\nAnyway, I’m leaving her with things like my mattress, my dresser, my couch and chair, all things that were a part of my childhood I took with me when I moved out of my parents. My parents would have otherwise thrown these things out. But I am SO FREAKISHLY SAD!!! I’m not even leaving this furniture forever, just for a few months until the lease is up and I can move things out. Like these forks and plates and everything have been around since my CHILDHOOD!! And I’m sad, I feel guilty almost for leaving them.\\n\\nFor whatever reason whenever I get sad about inanimate objects I think about the 1988 Pixar short film “Tin Toy”, basically a 5 min film about a toy and a baby. I think that it comes to mind bc of nostalgia but it also makes me SO FREAKISHLY SAD!!!! If you’ve seen it, something about the baby crying in the film and the toy getting upset he’s playing with the box at the very end makes me cry SO hard. Like I just want to hold all the toys and the baby and hug them and love them.\\n\\nAnyways two very similar sadnesses about things that I’m not sure if I should be sad about. That’s all!

However, I noticed foam everywhere on the counter where you\\'d leave clean dishes, and I gently reminded him to wipe that first. Perhaps my tone was a bit strong, and he jokingly said, \"I guess this will be our first argument.\" At this point, I thought he was serious and went for a cuddle to make up with him, but he pulled back, pointing at the water and the foams. I then went back to my room to fold clothes, out of sight out of mind, despite being worried that he was upset.\\n\\nThen we brushed our teeth, got in bed, and he cuddled me and told me, \"You\\'ve always been the one.\" I replied, \"The one... what?\" He then quietly said, \"The one I\\'ve been looking for.\" Mind you, I\\'m 31 and haven\\'t been in a long-term relationship for over 8 years now, due to not finding a compatible match. I\\'ve dated some people in the past but never wanted to spend my future with them nor did I love them.

A year ago, when I went to therapy, I opened the session with, \"What is love in a partnership?\" to my therapist, and we both thought it was a very difficult question to answer.Fast forward to seven amazing months with him; there wasn\\'t one time I didn\\'t feel like I\\'m the luckiest girl in the world. My partner is the best guy I\\'ve known, so I decided to muster all the courage to tell him I love him, especially he basically told me I\\'m the one he has always wanted. \\n\\nBut I overestimated myself being articulate. I basically told him the entire story about that therapy session and how I feel about him – like being sweet, kind, handsome, smart, ambitious, etc., and never did I feel like I\\'d come this far with someone. He patiently listened to me the whole time, but I just couldn\\'t get that damn \\'I love you\\' out. So I then asked, \"You get me?\" Hahaha, wtf, me. He said, \"Yes, baby, I get you,\" and I was like, \"Are you sure you get me?\" Haha, in the end, he told me apparently I\\'ve said that to him two weeks ago when we spent our Christmas together. I had no recollection of that... He said I woke up in the morning, kissed him, and said \\'I love you, baby,\\' then dozed off. He did not push me further all this time, but he knew. I wanted to dig a hole and hide away. Ah man, this is being in love, I guess.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"  \\nAs the title says - tracking every hour of my day fixed me and I thought I'd share the story.\\n\\nIn December 2020 I became a father, and in 2021 I was grappling with some serious depression and anxiety (not because of fatherhood); Used to working 12 - 14 hour days I was struggling to adjust to an 8 - 10 hour workday with the additional responsibilities of caring for a new child, keeping up with my responsibilities with friends and family, and being a partner to my wife. I felt like I had no free time and was falling behind on everything from chores to major deadlines.   \\nI went to therapy and tried journaling, tasking, goal setting, reframing - all the usual mechanics. Then I found Toggl.\\n\\nIn April 2022, I began tracking my time religiously, every hour was accounted for, and I wanted an easy way to keep tabs on my days without investing a lot of time in writing everything out.  The goal was simple, to honestly figure out where my time was going.  \\nMany of us tend to think we work more hours than we do and most of us tend to think we have less time than we actually do. When I started my tracking I realized I had much more time than I originally thought. \\n\\nI worked less than I thought I did and spent way more time with my son and partner.  I also realized that I was watching way too much TV and fiddling with my phone more than I could have imagined. \\n\\nLast year I spent 677 hours watching TV, that's 7.7% of my year! I spent 380 hours reading and 130 hours playing video games. Now, this doesn't necessarily compare with the amount of time spent sleeping, working, and taking care of my son but I found that time was there for me if I wanted it. \\n\\nIt completely changed how I thought about the problem.  \\nBecoming more aware of what I was doing between waking up and sleeping had an amazing effect on me. It reduced my anxiety, gave me back control over my daily hours, and instead of causing more panic helped reduce it.  \\nNow that a year has passed and I have a clear idea of how much I've been working, how many hours I spend on chores, and how much time I spend on leisure I can dedicate 2024 to tuning the dials in the direction that I want my life to go.   \\nJust thought I'd share this with anyone who may be going through something similar. Also, because this is the most common question I get when I share that I track my time: I spent 15 total hours over a year tracking my time and about 30 minutes writing this post.\\n\\nIf anyone is interested in a detailed breakdown of what a year and week looks like you can see it here:  \\n[https://imgur.com/a/gnf57as](https://imgur.com/a/gnf57as)  \\n\\n\\nTL:DR:  \\nGot over anxiety and depression by tracking every hour of my day for nearly two years.\",\n",

Here, it was always a safe space, my second home. It has shaped me into the person that I am today that I can’t put everything in words. I will be forever grateful of my parents’ hard work. This restaurant has been a mix of emotions from exhaustion from working on all of my breaks to my immense gratitude to my parents hard work. 18 years being built up from scratch from my parents, my dad working on the furniture, and planning the layout by scratch. It is incredibly hard to say goodbye. I have had many memories here and I can’t imagine my life without my second home.\\n\\nBut, my parents are tired. My Dad being on his feet for countless hours of the day, barely getting sleep. Building this restaurant from scratch, starting a restaurant without knowing all the details, my parents made a successful business enduring 18 years of hard work. My mom serving, training employees, stressing about if employees are going to show up, etc. Everyone that I see when I walk around our family business is a familiar face. I am really going to miss being here.It is a scary feeling, a lot of change is going to happen. I grew up with restaurant food. This restaurant business taught me more than any other experience than any other experience that I have had. Not only did I work here for the past summers, I would say I grew up here. From sitting at the first table on Saturdays and Sundays with my brother when we were young, to barely helping my mom out in the front, and to now. Our restaurant has seen us through every family obstacle, covid, almost through my entire college career, and more experiences that I had. It still has not hit me yet.\\n\\nMy mom’s favorite word to text me is “HURRY.” As I arrive on lunch and dinner during my winter break, I have been a bit overwhelmed but I know my parents really appreciate it. Over the past winter break and summers, it was a snippet of work than what my Dad did, being in a restaurant industry for 30 years. It’s hard to describe in words the outpouring of gratefulness that I have for both my mom and dad.\\n\\nI have been terrified for the last day of the restaurant. I was always stuck with this routine: go to the restaurant in the morning, head to my grandmas after to see her, then head back to the restaurant. I am just scared of change and how I am never going to experience that again. The last day will be in the end of January.Although this is a bittersweet goodbye, I am excited to travel with my parents and finally seeing my mom and dad relax. The world doesn’t end when you are 21 right?',\n",

While rummaging through the attic, I uncovered an old journal from my high school days, and oh boy, was it a rollercoaster of emotions and laughter!  \\nReading through it, I was transported back to those awkward teenage years. There were pages filled with my then 'profound' thoughts (which now seem hilariously naive), detailed accounts of my first crush (complete with cringe-worthy attempts to impress them), and my passionate rants about bands that have long since faded into obscurity. I even found some 'artistic' sketches that I was super proud of back then. Let's just say, my artistic skills have... not improved much.  \\nBut the best part? My predictions for the future. I had it all planned out – from becoming a rockstar to traveling the world. Some dreams faded, others evolved, but it's funny seeing how much my priorities have shifted.  \\nThis little journal has been a reminder of how far I've come and how much I've grown. It's a mix of face-palm moments and warm nostalgia that I didn't know I needed.  \\n\\n\\nHave any of you stumbled upon old diaries or journals? What gems did you find?

       "  'selftext': \"Hey there, \\n\\nIm a 25F who weighs 72kg (158.73lbs) 5'2 ft. I became overweight due to my nature of work in the BPO industry. My body wasn't always like this before working and my lowest weight was around 54kg. I really gained a lot of weight and now I decided to finally enroll in a gym. Yesterday was my first day at the gym and they required that I get a trainer since I basically dont know how to operate most of their machines there and told me that I need it due to my weight and for motivation. So while I was doing my workout with the trainer yesterday he made me do simple excercises at first like 5 mins treadmill, immobilizer and other stretches but what really made me breathe hard was when he asked me to pull the heavy cart that was filled with weights. He told me to pull a certain distance and then push the cart back to its place while tip toeing. This excercise made me extremely dizzy and my hearing became muffled. I had to lay down flat on the gym floor while my feet were elevated. I kind felt shy on how weak I was and some people were definitely  looking at me but this actually wasn't the first time I had experience this type of dizziness. I previously just jog on my own but once my body feels that it became too much it send a warning that I need to stop. So basically just go home at that point. But since I am enrolled in a gym and have a trainer I am really worried that I may not live upto the expectations of my trainer and I may experience this type of dizziness again while working out. If guys have any similar experiences or tips on how prevent this I would really appreciate this. Thank you guys.\\n\\nUpdate: GUYS thank you so much for all of your suggestions, tips and encouragement. Today is my third day at the gym and I followed all those recommendations you guys have given and I no longer get dizzyyy Yeeaaahhh  💪 🙏. I really appreciate you all 💞 and I hope good things come your way. Again thank you everyone 😊\",\n",

I do miss her to this day. \\n\\nSoon after her passing I found another older rescue, this one called Cota, who I adopted and have enjoyed living with since. Cota has a number of attributes that make it easy to understand why he had remained unadopted for so long (it had been years when I got him in 2022) but with time and patience he has become a wonderful companion.\\n\\nNow along with my tendency to adopt older creatures (and perhaps simply another symptom of my nature), I am a bit of a pack rat and I can get very sentimental over even small things. So during these years I have kept the teddy bear (even cleaned him up) for no particular reason that I can admit. My children are grown, no grandkids (yet), and I am divorced, so it’s just me a Cota. \\n\\nAbout four months ago I was doing some deep cleaning of my office and needed to move teddy. I amused myself by placing him on my bed and soon found his presence was a pleasant reminder of Lily, so there he stayed.\\n\\nAs I am of the habit of spending much too much time on my iPad surfing the web and whatnot, I recently discovered that when laying on my side Teddy, having by now fully graduated to a capitalized name, fits very comfortably under my neck and chin, supporting them better than my pillow as I read. And yes, it pleases me to cuddle up with Cota and remember Lily. \\n\\nAnd thus in my older years I have become a Teddy cuddling man.\\n\\n\\nSo anyone else cuddling their teddy bears at an older age as well?',\n",

I met him when I was 19 in university and we dated for 5 years, but when I got pregnant he realized he didn\\'t want any part of it.\\n\\nI am okay with this, but at times it has been hard to know the right approach with my child. when I try to look for information online I can never find anything about my situation, just things like absent fathers who are in and out, but not with 0 communication from day one. My child has no memories of him because he\\'s never been around. I decided to not talk about him, or talk about being a single parent, its always been the two of us and I figured when she\\'s ready she will ask.\\n\\nI\\'ve been waiting and waiting, I thought when she starts school she will ask, she didn\\'t. I thought on fathers day at school she will come home and ask, the class made fathers day gifts and she was the only one to make it for her mom. She still didn\\'t ask me about having a dad. She\\'s in her second year of school now, and we moved to a new area and one neighbor who comes to the bus stop is a very nosy woman as she asks invasive questions. I can tell I\\'ve been the topic of discussion in her home from what questions her 6 year old asks me, trying to find out if I drive, have a car, if my child in enrolled in any activities. Her son  must have asked my child about her dad on the bus or something, and my child told him she doesn\\'t have one, I know this because when we were out walking one day he said many time \"NAME doesn\\'t have a dad!\\' and I looked at my child to see if she was okay and she seemed fine.\\n\\nI started wondering if I was being a bad parent by not talking about it with her, but at the same time I didn\\'t want to approach her and be like \\'You have a dad but you can\\'t see him!\\' so I was in a tough position. Today we were talking about her grandpa and then I started telling stories of my grandpa, and she said \\'papa is not my dad though\\' and I told her right, he is my dad. We have been through this before but I saw the gears going in her mind and I knew I was about to get hit with the question.\\n\\n\\'do I have a dad?\\'\\n\\nwow, finally she has asked.  I told her yes, there is a man who fathered you, but he can\\'t be a dad. She asked what I meant by fathered and I reminded her that you need a man and a woman to make a baby (we have been through this before) but the man who fathered you can\\'t be a dad. She asked why, and I said because he is unable to, because of choices hes made and his life does not make that an option. I said it a bit better then I am explaining here, she asked me if he did something the involved the police (lol) and I said yes, and then she asked what it was and I told her I will tell her when she is older.\\n\\nAnyways, after a few questions she was back to talking about grandpas, and was being her happy usual self, it didn\\'t seem like this was a big revelation to her. I know I am not an expert in parenting or a child therapist, and if I could afford one I would have went and gotten some advice on this situation, however I think it went really well.\\n\\nShe is a very outgoing happy kid, who loves people and I was worried she would be upset about not knowing or being able to met him and she was not. I know she might in the future, and I am prepared to put her in therapy or do whatever it takes for her to be happy. I just feel good that it\\'s out there and it went pretty well.\\n\\nI hope I did not offend anyone with my post, and I am sorry if you think I did something wrong here.

Sleep a bit better and not as jittery .\\n\\nDay 10:  starting to feel like a new person stopped using diazepam as pa if attacks are rare now and even if they do happen I can get them u see control in no Time. Don’t feel jittery no more and my energy increased a lot as well!\\n\\nDay 14: most of them physical symptoms are gone now but I started getting mood swings and anger outburst throughout the day .\\n\\nDay 28: difference is like night and day . \\nI was always anxious and since stopping my physical and mental anxiety decreased by 70-80 percent .\\nI feel more stress resistant and my flight or fight mode is less sensitive !\\nMy hair and my skin condition greatly improved .\\nMy circulation is much better (before I alsways had cold feet and hands and I don’t get it anymore )\\nI feel like I am able to feel pleasure better than before .\\nI get loads of nostalgia because I feel like I did when I was a kid .Sleep is much better and I’m always energised !\\nThe only thing that I still have now is mood swings but every day it gets better.\\n\\nI only regret that I haven’t quit sooner and how much money I spent on this very unhealthy habit .\\nI thought I would never be able to quit . The longest I ever went without nicotine was 1 day . Usually 2-3 hours of nicotine and I would start going crazy and get very angry !\\n\\nI just want to say that if  I quit this poison then u can as well.',\n",

Like now taking time to actually learn about each member😭😭😭 and I say, I get it now!!! I see what you see army!!!!!!!!!!!! Jungkook, Jimin, V!!!!! It’s like a full circle moment! I hope one day to see them live😭I think I’d die!!!!! I started watching their YouTube channel and hehehehe each member is oh so cute ^_^',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'It seems easy enough to set boundaries, sitting in the safety of a therapist’s office or from the comfort of my own bed. But what I’ve realized through life experiences is that boundaries are so much more complicated than simply stating “that is/isn’t an acceptable behavior to engage in.” \\n\\nAlmost every time I’ve set a boundary, I’ve had to make a trade-off. Maybe I don’t hear about family drama that doesn’t involve me, but now I also leave my sister unsupported. Maybe I don’t let my mom trauma dump on me, but now I also stay awake at night worrying about her attempting to end her life again. Maybe I tell my friend I won’t take her engagement photos if she cancels one more time, but now we’ve lost some trust and ability to communicate. \\n\\nObviously there are times when a straightforward boundary is absolutely warranted. But the rest of the time, I feel like it’s not nearly that simple. I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts on this.',\n",

I’ve been in administration for almost 3 years, so my boss thought it would be a good idea for me to take a course in the hopes that I can further my career in that field and provide more for the company. Either courses take a year to complete, or they’re extortionately expensive—I only need a little, couple month course for a certificate! Jeez.\\n\\nAnyway, I found some great ones that fit the bill. Applied for them. Got an email back saying I didn’t qualify because I only had two GCSEs. I explained my situation, “I had issues in school, so I was homeschooled and we couldn’t afford the rest of the tests.” They practically hung up on me.\\n\\nThis has happened twice now, and it’s so disheartening—I never thought that part of my life would stunt my chances at a post-College age in furthering my education.
